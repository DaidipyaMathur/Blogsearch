(Or see a preview .) ___________ pro-cras-ti-na-tion |pr\u0259\u02cckrast\u0259\u02c8n\u0101SH\u0259n, pr\u014d-| noun the action of delaying or postponing something: your first tip is to avoid procrastination . Who would have thought that after decades of struggle with procrastination, the dictionary, of all places, would hold the solution. Avoid procrastination. So elegant in its simplicity. While we\u2019re here, let\u2019s make sure obese people avoid overeating, depressed people avoid apathy, and someone please tell beached whales that they should avoid being out of the ocean. No, \u201cavoid procrastination\u201d is only good advice for fake procrastinators\u2014those people that are like, \u201cI totally go on Facebook a few times every day at work\u2014I\u2019m such a procrastinator!\u201d The same people that will say to a real procrastinator something like, \u201cJust don\u2019t procrastinate and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s something they don\u2019t know how to not do. In college, the sudden unbridled personal freedom was a disaster for me\u2014I did nothing, ever, for any reason. The one exception was that I had to hand in papers from time to time. I would do those the night before, until I realized I could just do them through the night, and I did that until I realized I could actually start them in the early morning on the day they were due. This behavior reached caricature levels when I was unable to start writing my 90-page senior thesis until 72 hours before it was due, an experience that ended with me in the campus doctor\u2019s office learning that lack of blood sugar was the reason my hands had gone numb and curled up against my will. (I did get the thesis in\u2014no, it was not good.) Even this post took much longer than it should have, because I spent a bunch of hours doing things like seeing this picture sitting on my desktop from a previous post , opening it, looking at it for a long time thinking about how easily he could beat me in a fight, then wondering if he could beat a tiger in a fight, then wondering who would win between a lion and a tiger, and then googling that and reading about it for a while (the tiger would win). I have problems. To understand why procrastinators procrastinate so much, let\u2019s start by understanding a non -procrastinator\u2019s brain: Pretty normal, right? Now, let\u2019s look at a procrastinator\u2019s brain: Notice anything different? It seems the Rational Decision-Maker in the procrastinator\u2019s brain is coexisting with a pet\u2014the Instant Gratification Monkey. This would be fine\u2014cute, even\u2014if the Rational Decision-Maker knew the first thing about how to own a monkey. But unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a part of his training and he\u2019s left completely helpless as the monkey makes it impossible for him to do his job. The fact is, the Instant Gratification Monkey is the last creature who should be in charge of decisions\u2014he thinks only about the present, ignoring lessons from the past and disregarding the future altogether, and he concerns himself entirely with maximizing the ease and pleasure of the current moment. He doesn\u2019t understand the Rational Decision-Maker any better than the Rational Decision-Maker understands him\u2014why would we continue doing this jog, he thinks, when we could stop, which would feel better. Why would we practice that instrument when it\u2019s not fun? Why would we ever use a computer for work when the internet is sitting right there waiting to be played with? He thinks humans are insane. In the monkey world, he\u2019s got it all figured out\u2014if you eat when you\u2019re hungry, sleep when you\u2019re tired, and don\u2019t do anything difficult, you\u2019re a pretty successful monkey. The problem for the procrastinator is that he happens to live in the human world, making the Instant Gratification Monkey a highly unqualified navigator. Meanwhile, the Rational Decision-Maker, who was trained to make rational decisions, not to deal with competition over the controls, doesn\u2019t know how to put up an effective fight\u2014he just feels worse and worse about himself the more he fails and the more the suffering procrastinator whose head he\u2019s in berates him. It\u2019s a mess. And with the monkey in charge, the procrastinator finds himself spending a lot of time in a place called the Dark Playground. 1 The Dark Playground is a place every procrastinator knows well. It\u2019s a place where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn\u2019t actually fun because it\u2019s completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt, anxiety, self-hatred, and dread. Sometimes the Rational Decision-Maker puts his foot down and refuses to let you waste time doing normal leisure things, and since the Instant Gratification Monkey sure as hell isn\u2019t gonna let you work, you find yourself in a bizarre purgatory of weird activities where everyone loses. 2 And the poor Rational Decision-Maker just mopes, trying to figure out how he let the human he\u2019s supposed to be in charge of end up here again . Given this predicament, how does the procrastinator ever manage to accomplish anything? As it turns out, there\u2019s one thing that scares the shit out of the Instant Gratification Monkey: The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets too close or when there\u2019s danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or some other scary consequence. The Instant Gratification Monkey, normally unshakable, is terrified of the Panic Monster. How else could you explain the same person who can\u2019t write a paper\u2019s introductory sentence over a two-week span suddenly having the ability to stay up all night, fighting exhaustion, and write eight pages? Why else would an extraordinarily lazy person begin a rigorous workout routine other than a Panic Monster freakout about becoming less attractive? And these are the lucky procrastinators\u2014there are some who don\u2019t even respond to the Panic Monster, and in the most desperate moments they end up running up the tree with the monkey, entering a state of self-annihilating shutdown. Quite a crowd we are. Of course, this is no way to live. Even for the procrastinator who does manage to eventually get things done and remain a competent member of society, something has to change. Here are the main reasons why: 1) It\u2019s unpleasant. Far too much of the procrastinator\u2019s precious time is spent toiling in the Dark Playground, time that could have been spent enjoying satisfying, well-earned leisure if things had been done on a more logical schedule. And panic isn\u2019t fun for anyone. 2) The procrastinator ultimately sells himself short. He ends up underachieving and fails to reach his potential, which eats away at him over time and fills him with regret and self-loathing. 3) The Have-To-Dos may happen, but not the Want-To-Dos. Even if the procrastinator is in the type of career where the Panic Monster is regularly present and he\u2019s able to be fulfilled at work, the other things in life that are important to him\u2014getting in shape, cooking elaborate meals, learning to play the guitar, writing a book, reading, or even making a bold career switch\u2014never happen because the Panic Monster doesn\u2019t usually get involved with those things. Undertakings like those expand our experiences, make our lives richer, and bring us a lot of happiness\u2014and for most procrastinators, they get left in the dust. So how can a procrastinator improve and become happier?

He\u2019s there, he\u2019s not that sure why, we\u2019re not that sure why, but that\u2019s the situation. Is Wait But Why a blog or a real website? Again, we\u2019re not really sure. We want you to think it\u2019s a real website and when you forward the link to someone we don\u2019t want you to say, \u201cCheck out this guy\u2019s blog\u201d cause then it seems like it\u2019s just this guy writing and it\u2019s just a blog.  We want you to say, \u201cCheck out this site\u201d cause then we seem like a bigger deal and it seems like a legit thing.  Okay? Do you guys have jobs? Maybe you should spend less time asking us judgmental questions and more time realizing that you\u2019re on question 3 of an FAQ page on a procrastination website. Are you writing Wait But Why to distract yourself from the fact of your own mortality? Christ.  Yeah, probably that is deep down a bit of what\u2019s happening.  What the hell kind of question is that? It just seemed likely. Okay. Anything else? No.  Is there a reason we\u2019re still here? Oh if you\u2019re ready to leave, by all means let\u2019s leave.  I didn\u2019t want to be the one to suggest it since I work here. Yeah sorry it\u2019s kind of getting weird to be in here alone with you. Great.  You\u2019ve made your point clear.  And let\u2019s remember that you chose to come in here and no one is forcing you to stay. Okay I\u2019m just saying. Let\u2019s both move on. Agreed. Bye. Bye.

Here\u2019s how to reach us: General Questions or Feedback, or Business-Related: Contact[at]waitbutwhy.com Tim Urban: Tim[at]waitbutwhy.com Andrew Finn: Andrew[at]waitbutwhy.com Alicia McElhone: Alicia[at]waitbutwhy.com Speaking inquiries: Speaking[at]waitbutwhy.com Store-Related Questions: Shop[at]waitbutwhy.com Here\u2019s the deal with getting responses back from us: For business-related emails \u2014things about partnerships or translations or re-distribution or permissions, etc., we\u2019ll try to be back to you within 24 hours (unless we suspect that you emailed us as part of a mass or form email, in which case we\u2019ll probably not respond). If you\u2019re trying to reach us for business purposes and haven\u2019t heard back in a couple days, please email again\u2014your email either got lost in the shuffle or each person on our end thought someone else was responding to it. For store-related emails \u2014same 24-hour rule, and same \u201ctry again if you don\u2019t hear back\u201d advice. For content-related emails \u2014everything from praise to constructive feedback to good old fashion hate mail to your own musings about the world to a funny joke to an unfunny joke to your procrastination goals to anything else you want to email us about. Here\u2019s the situation: 1) Email us. We love getting your emails, and I promise you this\u2014whoever you email (the \u201ccontact\u201d email for both of us or the individual \u201ctim\u201d or \u201candrew\u201d emails for one of us) will read your email, every single time. Sometimes they back up and it takes a while, but neither of us is yet to archive an email without reading it. 2) You may or may not hear back from us, depending on a lot of things. We\u2019re lucky to receive a whole lot of emails, and while that really makes us happy, it\u2019s no longer realistic to promise a response to all of them. Sure, we could write back a one-word response or a uniform canned response or hire someone to respond for us\u2014but those are all kind of inauthentic and shitty ways to respond to what are almost always thoughtful reach-outs from the people who appreciate the site the most. We\u2019d rather do this\u2014whenever it\u2019s a down day or there\u2019s a week off from posting, we\u2019ll do whatever we can to catch up on responses, and sometimes an email comes in just as we\u2019re in a good place to respond and you\u2019ll hear back right away. Other times, you\u2019ll hear back eight months later and you\u2019ll have forgotten that you ever sent the email and it\u2019ll be weird. But right now, the backlog of need-a-response emails is in the thousands, and there\u2019s just not enough time to get to all of them. And if you never hear back, know that you were absolutely not ignored. You can also try to contact us through the Wait But Why Facebook or Twitter pages or through our personal social media accounts if you\u2019re a dedicated-enough stalker, but these are all less likely to get a response than emailing the WBW email addresses. Finally, you can contact us in a whole other way by commenting on the blog posts, either on the comment sections below each post or on the Wait But Why Facebook posts. We read each and every one of these too, and this is a great way to engage with us and the other Wait But Why readers.

Instant Gratification Monkey He's with you in the morning. He's with you at night. He's probably with you right now as you read this. So you might as well just learn to cuddle with him. And when he's really ruining your life, you can pick him up and slam him to the ground, or put him in the closet, or wring his little neck, as a reminder that this is your life and not his, goddammit. From the post: Why Procrastinators Procrastinate The Mammoth We all have a Social Survival Mammoth in our heads, and now you can hold one in your hands, or, if you must, thoroughly snuggle with it. In the mammoth post , we talked about our goal: to tame the mammoth so he goes from being a lumbering powerhouse to an adorable little pet. This plush toy mammoth is your reminder of how seriously we should be taking the mammoths in our heads. The Panic Monster You're a procrastinator and the Panic Monster is coming to get you. This squishy, more adorable version of the real thing can serve as a warning, a reminder of what's going to happen if you don't get your shit together on whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.

Everyone you know, everyone you admire, every hero in history\u2014they did it all with that same grid of empty boxes. The boxes can also be a reminder that life is forgiving. No matter what happens each week, you get a new fresh box to work with the next week.\" This is the large version, and the boxes are just big enough to write a few words in (approx 1/4\" x 1/4\").\u00a0 Posters are printed on 100lb\u00a0matte paper and best suited for ball point pen writing. Check out the pack options for bulk discounts on multiple posters. Due to the fragile nature of the posters and shipping couriers, we will not be able to accept returns on these.

Instant Gratification Monkey He's with you in the morning. He's with you at night. He's probably with you right now as you read this. So you might as well just learn to cuddle with him. And when he's really ruining your life, you can pick him up and slam him to the ground, or put him in the closet, or wring his little neck, as a reminder that this is your life and not his, goddammit. From the post: Why Procrastinators Procrastinate The Mammoth We all have a Social Survival Mammoth in our heads, and now you can hold one in your hands, or, if you must, thoroughly snuggle with it. In the mammoth post , we talked about our goal: to tame the mammoth so he goes from being a lumbering powerhouse to an adorable little pet. This plush toy mammoth is your reminder of how seriously we should be taking the mammoths in our heads. The Panic Monster You're a procrastinator and the Panic Monster is coming to get you. This squishy, more adorable version of the real thing can serve as a warning, a reminder of what's going to happen if you don't get your shit together on whatever it is you're supposed to be doing.

For those who want to support Wait But Why, thank you! We exist only because of reader support (there are no ads on the site cause ads are gross), and your support goes a long way. Wait But Why is free and will always be free. And you\u2019re allowed to leave this page and reject the concept of supporting the site. We still like you. If you\u2019d like to help us keep doing what we do, there are five great ways: 1) Spread the word. A free way to help us in a massive way is to simply tell your friends about the site and share our articles on social media. 2) Make a small monthly pledge through Patreon . Patreon is a service made for this exact situation.\u00a0You can click the button below to see our page and my video explainer: WBW ON PATREON 3) Make a one-time donation below or through PayPal . If monthly pledges aren\u2019t your thing, normal donation works great too. 4) Check out our store . Buy something if you like what\u2019s there (or send us feedback about what should be there if you don\u2019t like anything). 5) Subscribe. The best way for a blog to grow a long-lasting readership is with email subscriptions. Plus, it\u2019s easier than having to remember to come back to the site again and again or guess exactly when Tim will post each new article.

About the book Hi, I\u2019m Tim. I write the blog Wait But Why, where I write about all kinds of things. But in the middle of 2016, I started thinking about a new topic: why my society sucked. As technology soared ahead, it seemed like we were going backwards in wisdom. Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. I decided to write about it, which plunged me into a rabbit hole like no other. Six years later, I emerged with this book. The book introduces a new framework for thinking about our complex political environment. With dozens of new terms and concepts and 303 drawings, it\u2019s a toolbox for understanding our societies, our group dynamics, and our own minds. Here\u2019s everything on all the pages: See how much shit is in there? That took a really long time and I\u2019m happy it\u2019s over. Anyway, stop procrastinating by reading all the way down on this page and go read the book, and then we can discuss.

I have spent much of the past six months trying to understand the world of Bitcoin, Ethereum, alt-coins, crypto currencies, crypto commodities, and crypto tokens .

The top 1% make about the same total income as the bottom 40% combined, which is significant, but it is nothing compared to the wealth gap. The top 1% have 139x as much wealth as the bottom 40%. So, why are income and capital gains tax rates based on income, not wealth?\u00a0This is an outdated and oversimplistic way to ballpark wealth, and modern technology makes it much easier for track wealth now than in the past. If we want to devise a more sensible tax system, we should strongly consider basing income and capital tax rates on a metric I will call Liquid Net Worth, instead of the traditional \u201ctaxable income\u201d. This ensures that tax rates are assessed on a more full picture of someone\u2019s financial situation, not just their year-to-year income.

I\u2019m Jake Tapper.</p>\n<p><strong>Dana Bash: </strong>And I\u2019m Dana Bash. Let\u2019s get started.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>We\u2019ll begin with the economy. President Biden, since you took office, inflation has slowed but prices remain high. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Look at what Mr. Trump left me when I became president. We had an economy in free fall. Everyone was unemployed. Thousands were dying of Covid, it was like a zombie apocalypse, and Trump was just drinking bleach. Then I came to office and put the pieces back together. We brought insulin shots down to 15 dollars. Senior citizens pay no more than 200 dollars a year for healthcare.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>We had the greatest economy in the history of this world or any other world. There are some great fictional worlds out there, like the Emerald City, which by the way has a great economy, but not as good as ours. No economy had ever done as well as ours did when I was in office. Everybody was amazed by it. All the other countries said they wished I was their president. In Asia or Europe or Peru, go ask them and they\u2019ll tell you how amazed they were by the job I did. Inflation is killing us.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>A better economy than the Emerald City? I don\u2019t know anyone who thinks that. My friend who I talked to the other day doesn\u2019t think that. He said you were a worse president than Herbert Hoover, and that\u2019s saying something because Herbert Hoover could give a rat\u2019s ass who shows up at the local gooseberry growing contest. I don\u2019t know what happened at last year\u2019s contest but those are some good gooseberries. When Trump was president we were still killing people in Afghanistan. I\u2019m the only president where no one has died anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, you say you want to extend the tax cuts you put in place. With the U.S. facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The tax cuts are why we had the greatest economy in human or animal history. I was just about to zero out the debt when Covid hit. So instead I made the vaccine, and it was a tremendous vaccine, and then he took over and did a very poor job. When I was president the whole world loved America and admired me. Now we\u2019re a disgusting piss-covered Third World country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019m going to fix the tax system. We have a trillion thousandaires in this country\u2014excuse me, a million trillionaires. Billionaires pay only $150 in taxes. I paid more than that when I worked at Padula\u2019s ice cream stand when I was 15. I paid the taxes I owed. If billionaires paid their fair share we\u2019d be able to wipe out the debt. We\u2019d be able to pay for childcare, eldercare, healthcare. We\u2019d be able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u2019ve been able to do with, dealing with everything we have to do with everything that we have to be able to deal with.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tapper:</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>The.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tapper:</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>We finally beat Medicare.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>For fuck\u2019s sake. Okay let\u2019s talk about Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Everyone wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and I mean everyone. And I did that. These people are sick. They want to abort eight-month fetuses. Nine-month fetuses. Newborn babies. Older fatter babies. Boddlers. Toddlers. There\u2019s no one these people won\u2019t abort. President Biden tries to abort his political opponents. It\u2019s a disaster.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>President Biden?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>It\u2019s ridiculous to say everyone wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. I didn\u2019t. My friend didn\u2019t. The women didn\u2019t, including that one who was murdered by an immigrant. He went to the funeral. But here\u2019s the deal. There\u2019s a lot of women raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, by their brothers and sisters, by their children and grandmothers, it\u2019s ridiculous, I saw this one video where the pool boy came into the house looking all sweaty and asked for a glass of water, and you know how that goes, you\u2019ve seen the videos, and then they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>President Biden, on the issue of border security, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch. Why should voters trust you to solve this crisis?</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I hired more border patrol. I hired more asylum officers. This is why there are no more illegal immigrants. He put babies in cages. I\u2019m going to continue until we get the total initiative relative to what we\u2019re going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers eating a salami on Wednesday.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I have no idea what the fuck he said at the end there and I don\u2019t think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of borders, and then he just opened them right up. He opened them to prisoners and lunatics and rapists and child molesters and terrorists and wildlings and white walkers. These are not good people. We had the safest border in history according to border patrol who, by the way, endorsed me for president, I won\u2019t say that here but they endorsed me, I won\u2019t talk about it but it was Brandon, Brandon from border patrol endorsed me, I won\u2019t mention his name here but it was Brandon R. Knight who lives at 246 Longmeadow Drive in El Paso with his dogs, beautiful dogs by the way, it was the safest border and now we have the worst border in history. And these migrants are staying at the best hotels, great five-star hotels, while our veterans are on the street because he hates veterans.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Okay everything he just said is a lie. For example, I don\u2019t hate veterans, I\u2019d give my life for a veteran. I\u2019d give a veteran a handjob in a Denny\u2019s bathroom. We\u2019ve done more for veterans than anyone in American history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Let\u2019s talk about Russia and Ukraine. Former President Trump, Vladimir Putin says he\u2019ll only end the war if he gets to keep some of Ukraine and Ukraine stops trying to join NATO. Are Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Our veterans can\u2019t stand Biden. They think he\u2019s the worst commander-in-chief that we\u2019ve ever had. They wouldn\u2019t take a handjob from him in a Denny\u2019s bathroom even if they were desperate. If we had a real president, Putin never would have invaded Ukraine. And Hamas never would have attacked Israel. When I was president, Hamas liked Israel. You know those silly little caps Jews wear on their head? When I was president, Hamas wore those caps too. Out of respect for me. President Biden is like a Palestinian, and not one of the good ones either, he\u2019s a bad one, he\u2019s a weak Palestinian, he\u2019s not even one of the scary Palestinians, he can\u2019t even yell \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d correctly and the other Palestinians can\u2019t stand him, they can\u2019t stand this guy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019ve never heard so much malarkey in my life. I\u2019m a great Palestinian.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Former President Trump, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state to achieve peace in the region?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I make great deals. I made great deals as a kid. As a teenager. As an adult. As an old man. I made NATO put up biyyons and biyyons of dollars. I told them, if you don\u2019t pay, I don\u2019t play. And you know what happened? Biyyons and biyyons of dollars came flowing in the next day. But now we\u2019re paying everyone\u2019s bills again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, I want to talk about January 6<sup>th</sup>. After you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol. As president, you swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe you violated that oath on January 6<sup>th</sup> and worry that you\u2019ll do it again?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Let me tell you about January 6<sup>th</sup>. On January 6<sup>th</sup>, we had a secure border. On January 6<sup>th</sup>, we were energy independent. On January 6<sup>th</sup>, somewhere out there, a little boy had his first hamburger because we had made America great.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Please answer the question.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I had nothing to do with anything that happened on On January 6<sup>th</sup>. Even Nancy Pelosi said that. She said, \u201cPresident Trump had nothing to do with January 6<sup>th</sup>, it was all my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He\u2019s a convicted felon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>His son is a convicted felon.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He had sex with a porn star in the other room while his wife was giving birth. He has the morals of an alley cat.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Alley cats: </strong>wtf</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star in the other room while my wife was giving birth, she had sex with me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He said fine people on both sides.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Yes you did. He said Hitler has done good things.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Only some.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>President Biden, black Americans are struggling. What do you say to black Americans who are disappointed you haven\u2019t made more progress?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019ve helped black Americans in all kinds of ways. It\u2019s inflation that\u2019s hurting them, not me.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You caused the inflation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I know you did but what did I do?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>President Trump, will you do anything to slow the climate crisis?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The blacks love me. They made me an honorary black.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bash:</strong></p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>When I was president, I had stopped climate change. I had the best environmental numbers in history.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I passed the most extensive climate change legislation in history. Blacks love me. I built labs in historically black colleges so they could do science like white colleges.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Illegals are destroying our country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>And by the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden:</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, the average cost of childcare in this country has risen past $11,000/year per child. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, the question was about childcare.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>China.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Illegals are killing this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Democrats pay too much for hostages. I pay almost nothing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>K. President Biden, frankly you\u2019re old as cock. How do you address concerns about this?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I used to be young. America is a great country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Former President Trump, you\u2019re also appallingly old. How do you address the same concerns?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I just won two club championships. To do that you have to be smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. He couldn\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards. I have the body and mind of a 23-year-old.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019m a six handicap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>My tits you are.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019m an eight handicap.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I\u2019ve seen your swing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election and say political violence of any form is unacceptable?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course political violence is unacceptable. I hated when Nancy Pelosi ushered in all those people to the Capitol on January 6<sup>th</sup>. I\u2019m running because he\u2019s the worst president in the history of this country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Putin never would have attacked Ukraine if I had been president.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>If the election is fair and free and I win of course I\u2019ll accept the results.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Whiner.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Complainer.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Tapper: </strong>It is blessedly now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements. Time for the big, lofty, heartfelt speech.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I didn\u2019t raise taxes on most people. He instituted a 10% tariff, which is the same as raising taxes. He wants to make it so we can\u2019t negotiate with big pharma companies. We got it down to $35 for insulin, which is $20 more than I said earlier in the debate, and a $2,000 cap for senior healthcare spending, which is ten times the figure I said earlier tonight. That\u2019s huge progress in just a couple hours.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>This guy sucks. All he does is let people pour in over the border. We\u2019re living in a hellish rat\u2019s nest. No one likes you. No one respects you. God I\u2019m good. No one\u2019s ever seen anything like it before. We live in a shit country. Because of you, I need to make America great again again.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Bash: </strong>Thank you I guess.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">_______</p>\n<h4><strong>More places to go:</strong></h4>\n<p>Presidential debate transcripts from <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>2020</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/second-presidential-debate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>2016</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>My book about how our politics got to this state</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/american-presidents-washington-lincoln.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The American Presidents: Washington to Lincoln</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">_______</p>\n\n\n\n<script async data-uid=\"047cbbd566\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.ck.page/047cbbd566/index.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our <strong><a data-formkit-toggle=\"047cbbd566\" href=\"https://newsletter.waitbutwhy.com/join\">email list</a></strong> and we&#8217;ll send you new posts when they come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support Wait But Why, visit our <strong><a data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" href=\"https://patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Patreon page</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2024/06/debate2024.html\">The 2024 Trump-Biden Debate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> https://waitbutwhy.com/2024/06/debate2024.html/feed 84 10569 All My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro https://waitbutwhy.com/2024/02/vision-pro.html https://waitbutwhy.com/2024/02/vision-pro.html#comments Tim Urban Fri, 09 Feb 2024 18:24:38 +0000 Uncategorized future science technology https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=10470 <p>Welcome to the 2030s.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2024/02/vision-pro.html\">All My Thoughts After 40 Hours in the Vision Pro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> <p>\n  I\u2019m writing this on a 30-foot screen on top of a 10,000-foot mountain in Hawaii, at a table in an Austin coffee shop where I\u2019m pretty sure other people are taking photos of me to send to their friends so they can all call me a piece of shit. In the last week, life has gotten weird.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  My journey to the Haleakal\u0101 shield volcano Austin coffee shop began more than 30 years ago, in 1990, when my parents brought me to something called a \u201cvirtual reality exhibit\u201d at the Seaport World Trade Center in Boston. I stood on a little circular pedestal, and the guy handed me a plastic gun and put a big headset on me. Suddenly I was in some cartoon world, in a military uniform, holding a real gun. The person on the pedestal next to me was there, also a cartoon, also holding a gun. After some janky waving and shooting, they kicked me out for the next person in line. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I had recently read <em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em>, where a kid in the real world crosses a magic threshold and enters a cartoon world.<em> </em>This felt like that. I wanted more.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then VR disappeared for 25 years. Throughout the \u201890s and 2000s, \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was a forgotten dream\u2014a cool concept that never made it. But in the mid-2010s, VR made an unexpected comeback. 20-year-old Palmer Luckey\u2019s duct-taped headset prototype had impressed enough investors for Oculus to become a real company. In 2014, Facebook bought Oculus. Google and Sony got involved. It was all finally happening.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In 2016, I decided to write about the VR revolution. I went around Silicon Valley, interviewing people at Google and Facebook to get the full scoop on VR. I even sat down with Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1139\" height=\"797\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10477\" style=\"width:600px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck.png 1139w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-600x420.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-750x525.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Zuck-768x537.png 768w \" sizes=\"(max-width: 1139px) 100vw, 1139px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I demoed everything. It was mind-blowing. VR was about to take over the world. And I was gonna be the one to tell everyone.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then two things happened:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\n  VR didn\u2019t take over the world.\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>   I didn\u2019t write a VR post because I fell into a six-year <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">book</a> hole instead. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>   From the bottom of my book hole, I kept following the story. At Facebook\u2019s 2016 developer conference, Zuckerberg had demoed a new bleeding-edge kind of \u201cstandalone, inside out\u201d headset. Up until then, there were two ways to do VR: The first was with a cheap headset, maybe using your phone as a screen, that could do primitive head-movement tracking but had no way to see the environment around you. The second was with external sensors on the walls and a headset that attached to a high-powered PC with a cord. \u201cStandalone\u201d meant the new headset would have the computer inside, with no need for a cable. \u201cInside out\u201d meant the headset could see the room around you, so you didn\u2019t need external sensors. In 2016, this was just a prototype. Three years later, Facebook launched Oculus Quest.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In 2020, standing around during Covid with my dick in my hand like everyone else, I got myself a Quest 2. It was amazing. I loved it. It was my daily post-writing reward activity. I made <a href=\"https://www.tiltbrush.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3D art</a>. I <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2134272053250863/?ranking_trace=0_2134272053250863_SKYLINEWEBQUESTSEARCH_1vKvJ1edv2vQxMeJK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">swam with whales</a>. I went on <a href=\"https://vacationsimulatorgame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cartoon vacations</a>. I exercised by <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2448060205267927/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slashing music</a>. I beat <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/experiences/2718107161580827/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trover</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   Then, for some reason, I stopped. I can\u2019t really explain why. I really loved being in the Quest 2. I recently dusted it off to give friends a demo and they were floored, reminding me how great it is. It just didn\u2019t <em>hook </em>me. Maybe it was the solo aspect. I don\u2019t have friends who do VR so there\u2019s no one else to play with. Maybe it\u2019s the friction. It\u2019s minor, but charging the headset, putting it on, and creating a boundary<a href=\"#footnote-1-10470\" id=\"note-1-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> is still a lot more friction than picking up my phone. Maybe my delight relied more on novelty than I realized. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   It\u2019s not just me. VR blows everyone away when they try it, but it seems to have a hard time hooking people for the long run. After a major wave of hype in the mid-2010s, VR receded into the land of subcultures. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  And the question is: Is there some fatal flaw to the concept of VR that will always prevent it from achieving mass adoption? Or are we some tipping point away from VR exploding into the stratosphere like the computer and smartphone?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enter Apple</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>   Everyone remembers where they were when they learned that JFK was shot, a man had landed on the moon, or airplanes had flown into the Twin Towers. I remember where I was when I saw Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQKMoT-6XSg&amp;ab_channel=ProtectstarInc.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unveil the first iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I didn\u2019t always like Apple. My family\u2019s first computer was an Apple 2GS. But then, like many early Apple computer users, I became a PC person. I used an IBM ThinkPad in college and thought Apple people were annoying.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then Steve Jobs came back to Apple and started Making Apple Great Again. My post-college music composing path forced me to get a 2004 PowerBook G4. After getting used to the interface (<em>why</em> <em>the fuck is there no start button?</em>), I realized that Macs were amazing, and I\u2019ve been an annoying Apple person ever since. But it wasn\u2019t until 2007 that I became a <em>fanboy.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In the presentation, when Jobs did the world\u2019s first \u201cswipe to unlock,\u201d the audience made an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?si=_ruGaoE1NWaLBrjC&amp;t=933\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">audible gasp</a>. A minute later, he brought up a list of artists in the phone\u2019s \u201ciPod\u201d app and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VQKMoT-6XSg?si=WXikR3ntj4j3EXd-&amp;t=972\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked</a>, \u201cWell, how do I scroll through my list of artists? I just take my finger and scroll.\u201d Another audible gasp. It\u2019s weird that something so normal today was jaw-dropping 17 years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The feeling I had watching that presentation had happened before. I felt it when I was five years old and tried Nintendo for the first time at a friend\u2019s house (<em>I can make something on the TV move by clicking this button??</em>). I felt it in the early \u201890s when my friend showed me how to send an email (<em>You can type something on your computer, hit a button, and it shows up on mine??)</em>.<em> </em>I felt it the first time I test-drove a Tesla (<em>Why is this car accelerating so futuristically?</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I\u2019ve learned to see a lot of meaning in these holy shit moments. In most cases, they\u2019ve been followed by an entirely new industry sweeping the world\u2014like the smartphone, video game, internet, and electric car revolutions.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   In June 2023, Apple <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYkq9Rgoj8E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">announced</a> the VR\u2014sorry, <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/software/apple-tells-developers-not-to-use-virtual-reality-when-talking-about-vision-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>spatial computing</em></a><em>\u2014</em>headset that had been long rumored: the Vision Pro.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  I watched the presentation, but it wasn\u2019t quite like my experience in 2007. First, I had gotten excited about VR multiple times in the past and ended up disappointed. Second, unlike demoing an iPhone, watching a VR demo on a 2D screen just doesn\u2019t show you what it\u2019s actually like. Oh, also, it was <em>$3,500. </em>I happily shelled out $600 for the first iPhone. But $3,500? For a V1 product that will get way better (and cheaper) in the next few years? When I already have a Meta Quest? Nah. I might be a fanboy but I\u2019m not a chump. It was the obvious grown-up decision to wait it out. Then I ordered one in the first minute after preorders started.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  This Monday morning, I went to the Apple Store to put the Vision Pro on my chump face for the first time. The staff member guided me through a demo. And there it was: the holy shit moment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But it was a holy shit moment with an asterisk. I had experienced full holy shit moments both in 1990 and in 2016 with VR, and these were the notable exceptions to the \u201choly shit moments are a surefire omen of an industry about to blow up\u201d rule. Was this time different or would history repeat itself?\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  What I did know was that it was finally time to write a VR post. I wanted to post this week while everyone was hyped up about the Vision Pro. But I didn\u2019t want to write about it before I had used it a <em>lot</em>, so I could experience not only the honeymoon phase but also what it was like to get thoroughly sick of it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The plan was clear. I went home, told my wife that I would be deeply ignoring her and our baby for the week, and spent twelve hours a day in the headset for four straight days. I\u2019m writing this on Thursday afternoon, having already logged over forty hours. Here are my thoughts.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vision Pro, V1</strong>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There are three elements of any VR system: hardware, operating system, and applications. Let\u2019s talk about each.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hardware</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-600x337.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10480\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-600x337.jpg 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-750x422.jpg 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset-768x432.jpg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/headset.jpg 980w \" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   Apple Vision Pro (AVP)<a href=\"#footnote2-1-10470\" id=\"note2-1-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a> is heavy\u2014a decent amount heavier (650 grams) than Meta\u2019s Quest 3 (515 grams). It comes with a fancy band that goes on easily and you tighten with a little knob. It\u2019s awesome. For 12 minutes. Then it started killing my face. With 3,500 regrets, I switched to the other band it comes with, which includes a loop that goes over the top of your head, and thank god for that because it was <em>way </em>better\u2014so good that I am shocked to say that even at the end of a full day wearing it, I didn\u2019t feel a euphoric \u201cahhh\u201d relief taking it off. At least right now, it seems only a little more uncomfortable than wearing over-ear headphones for long periods of time. This might not apply to everyone, but I have not felt nauseous once while wearing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing that sucks about wearing it. The \u201cfield of view\u201d isn\u2019t great, meaning there are thick black walls where your peripheral vision is supposed to be, which is a bummer. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s great for your eyes. And there\u2019s no way around the fact that you feel like an asshole when other people are in the room. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There\u2019s an external battery pack that connects to the headset with a cord and typically lives in my pocket. The battery lasts about three hours, but you can plug in the battery to make it last forever, like a computer if the battery only lasted for three hours. (You\u2019re often using it in conjunction with your computer, which makes it a non-issue because you can plug the battery into the computer.)\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   When you put the headset on, it does the AVP version of Face ID: scanning your irises. This is seamless and very futuristic. Then, you see exactly what you saw before putting the headset on. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86Gy035z_KA&amp;ab_channel=MarquesBrownlee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lots</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7hJlyVDEc8&amp;ab_channel=CleoAbram\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">of</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reviewers</a> have marveled over AVP\u2019s \u201cpass-through\u201d capabilities, and the second I put it on, I understood why. While it\u2019s not perfect, it\u2019s <em>almost </em>like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. The headset is in fact opaque\u2014cameras on the outside transmit the world onto screens on the inside. But the screens are so good and the latency so low that it really seems transparent. Then there\u2019s the much less successful attempt to make it look transparent from the outside as well, using cameras on the inside to broadcast your eyes onto the front of the headset. The goal is that if you\u2019re talking to someone while wearing the headset, it feels to <em>both </em>people like you\u2019re wearing a transparent snorkeling mask. But at least in V1, the eyes don\u2019t show up nearly as well as <a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/applead-eyes.png\">advertised</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The internal screens save energy by doing something clever called \u201cfoveated rendering\u201d\u2014i.e. only putting the exact place you\u2019re looking in perfect focus while making the rest of the view lower-res. This is what your actual eyes do, which is why your peripheral vision is blurry. If you watch this <a href=\"https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1755000159698612346?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">viewcast</a> I made, you\u2019ll see that most of it is blurry (the sharp part was where I happened to be looking while taking it)\u2014but as the person in the headset, I only ever saw perfect sharpness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The way Vision Pro does audio is also cool. There have always been two sound options for me while on my phone or computer: play from the speaker and everyone can hear it or put on headphones and no one can hear it. AVP speakers are somewhere in between. The speakers (which sound great) are small and right above your ears, and while people right next to you can hear what you\u2019re hearing, people in the next room cannot. So in a coffee shop or on an airplane, you still need headphones, but I do a lot of my work in an office in our house with the door open, and it\u2019s been nice to work both without headphones <em>and </em>without bothering anyone in the other room. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Operating System</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  This was the biggest holy shit of my holy shit moment. Apple is the king of simple intuitive interfaces. Part of what drew those gasps in 2007 was how <em>natural </em>the iPhone\u2019s interface was. You scrolled down by pushing the page up, just like you would in real life. You zoomed by pinching with two fingers. It seemed like magic. AVP\u2019s interface is gaspworthy for the same reason. The main gesture is what I\u2019ve been calling the \u201ceye pinch.\u201d\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   When you press the button at the top of the headset, your apps come up, floating in the room in front of you, looking as real as any other object in the room. They&#8217;re fixed in space. You can walk right up to them, and the detail is amazing.<a href=\"#footnote2-2-10470\" id=\"note2-2-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">2</a>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"835\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10482\" style=\"width:600px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom.png 835w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-600x367.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-750x459.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/appsinroom-768x470.png 768w \" sizes=\"(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   Vision Pro\u2019s eye tracking is outrageously good. It knows <em>precisely </em>where you\u2019re looking. So all you do to select an app is look at it and tap your thumb and index finger together. Your hand doesn\u2019t need to move up to do this, just somewhere the headset can see it. Watching the ads, it seemed like this might be annoying to do, but it\u2019s every bit as easy and intuitive as opening an app on a smartphone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   No matter what you\u2019re doing, the eye pinch is the equivalent of touching a finger to a smartphone screen. To scroll, look anywhere in the window, pinch, and move your hand up. To move a window, look at the little bar below the window, pinch, and move it where you want to. To resize the window, look at the window\u2019s corner, pinch, and resize. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   As John Gruber put it in his <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">review</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The fundamental interaction model in VisionOS feels like it will be copied by all future VR/AR headsets, in the same way that all desktop computers work like the Mac, and all phones and tablets now work like the iPhone. And when that happens, some will argue that of course they all work that way, because how else could they work? But personal computers didn\u2019t have point-and-click GUIs before the Mac, and phones didn\u2019t have \u201cit\u2019s all just a big touchscreen\u201d interfaces before the iPhone. No other headset today has a \u201cjust look at a target, and tap your finger and thumb\u201d interface today. I suspect in a few years they all will.</em>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   Then there\u2019s the fact that everything you see in front of you is available desktop to work with. On my computer, I\u2019m used to my applications being stacked, and I toggle between them. Or maybe I put a few vertical windows side by side. In AVP, I can put one eight-foot window in front of me, two more on either side of it, and a couple more <em>above </em>them in the sky. Then, if I get up to go to the other room, the windows all stay exactly where they are, waiting for me to come back. If I want to switch work spots, I just hold the headset button and the whole configuration jumps to the new location. This is all way cooler than I\u2019m making it sound, so I made a video to show you how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"My Work Day in a Vision Pro\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3CZD-K04KI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>   One thing you\u2019ll notice in the video is that I routinely spin the digital crown on the headset to slide between being entirely in reality, partially in reality, and entirely in a virtual landscape. This is ridiculously fun to do. And it\u2019s a general reminder that AR and VR<a href=\"#footnote-2-10470\" id=\"note-2-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a> being separate categories is a thing of the past. In the Vision Pro, the Quest 3, and any future headset, you can be 100% in the real world (when there\u2019s nothing on the screen and it seems like you\u2019re wearing a snorkeling mask), you can be mostly in the real world except there\u2019s a virtual <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dJu9VyIw64?si=CXyrl8KvUcYQ5uYZ&amp;t=449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">game board</a> on your kitchen table or a little virtual butterfly fluttering around. You can be halfway between reality and virtual when, say, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-dJu9VyIw64?si=N85diDS1-4EDe5-1&amp;t=476\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">portals open up</a> in the walls around you during a game. Or you can go full virtual. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Apps</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There are many categories of spatial computing apps\u2014productivity, entertainment, social, gaming, creative, fitness\u2014and for most of them today, you\u2019ll need a Meta Quest or some other non-Apple headset. There are a small handful of astounding<em> </em>apps for AVP, but they\u2019re more a sampling of what\u2019s possible than an actual app store.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The most \u201cyou can absolutely not do this anywhere but a VR headset\u201d thing I did was their little taster menu of immersive entertainment. Entertainment on a headset runs on a spectrum of immersion. The least immersive is watching a normal movie on a massive screen in a virtual space like the moon or a giant theater. Those movies you missed that everyone says are best seen on the big screen\u2014you can see those on a big screen now. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Next are movies that are framed in a normal rectangle, but they\u2019re 3D looking\u2014like when we used to wear those stupid paper glasses but much, much better. Sometimes, these surprise you when something comes <em>out </em>of the screen to fly through the air or stand on the floor between you and the screen. The AVR comes with one of these\u2014\u201cEncounter Dinosaurs\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s delightful. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Finally, there\u2019s full immersion, where the scene entirely surrounds you and you actually feel like you\u2019re there. These are better described as \u201cexperiences\u201d than \u201centertainment.\u201d I saw rhinos up close in person last year. Then, this week, I did one of the Vision Pro experiences that\u2019s an up-close hang with rhinos. These two experiences were <em>very </em>similar. Another experience lets you sit in on an Alicia Keys rehearsal where she sings some songs standing two feet away from you. You can watch her for a while, then look over at what the drummer or keyboardist is doing for a while\u2014just like you would if you were actually there.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Photos and videos are also cool. When you take a panoramic photo, you sweep your phone around in a C-shaped arc\u2014but on a flat phone screen, the result is a flat photo. In AVP, panos are C-shaped, like the photo you actually took. The C wraps around you, which I quickly learned brings the memory back way better than the flat version. You can also turn the headset into a camera and record photos and videos, both of which are immersive. When you later view them in the headset, they\u2019re 3D, putting you right back into the actual scene.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then there\u2019s the infamous Vision Pro avatars. You get one of these by flipping the headset around and letting it take pictures of you from different angles. Then when you FaceTime someone, your avatar mimics whatever facial expressions you\u2019re making. Here\u2019s mine:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"636\" height=\"586\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10504\" style=\"width:400px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar.png 636w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timavatar-600x553.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first person I tested it out on was my wife, who immediately gasped in horror, saying I had \u201clittle uncanny valley snake eyes rolling around in my skull,\u201d whatever the fuck that means.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The uncanny valley she\u2019s upset about is this:<a href=\"#footnote2-3-10470\" id=\"note2-3-10470\" rel=\"footnote2\">3</a>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-600x324.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10483\" style=\"width:550px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-600x324.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-750x405.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-768x415.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-1536x830.png 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley-239x130.png 239w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/uncannyvalley.png 2001w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The idea is that we like faces that are somewhat humanlike, and we like faces that are totally humanlike, but we <em>hate </em>faces that are almost-but-not-totally humanlike.

Now they\u2019ve gotten so good they\u2019ve plunged into the uncanny valley. This was always gonna happen at some point on the road to perfect avatars and that time is now.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   To test it out for myself, I FaceTimed my friend <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@julesterpak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jules Terpak</a>, who also has a Vision Pro. First I put her across from me at this table while we sat around with each other\u2019s uncanny valley faces for a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1082\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10484\" style=\"width:550px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office.jpg 2000w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-600x325.jpg 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-750x406.jpg 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-768x415.jpg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-1536x831.jpg 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jules-Office-239x130.jpg 239w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  One very cool thing is that when I moved her window to a different seat at the table, her voice shifted locations to that spot.

It\u2019s the next step in a centuries-long human mission to conquer long-distance. First there were letters, then phone calls, then mobile phones<a href=\"#footnote-3-10470\" id=\"note-3-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> and video calls. The next step is VR hangouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   By far the thing I spent the most time doing in the Vision Pro was exactly what I normally do, but the AVP version. When you\u2019re sitting down in front of your computer while wearing the headset, you can open your computer screen as a giant virtual window (which you still control with your normal keyboard and trackpad). Whatever screen you\u2019re used to working on is now much, much bigger. It\u2019s also much more mobile. I don\u2019t usually work on the couch because I prefer my big monitor over my laptop screen. This week, I spent a lot of time working on my couch on a 100-inch monitor. I don\u2019t normally work lying flat in bed because the laptop screen isn\u2019t directly above me. This week I did, putting the screen up on the ceiling. I did some work outside on the porch and some more under a tree. Sometimes I saw the room around me, only with a big screen floating in it. Other times, I went fully immersive, writing on a mountain top, a sand dune, or the moon. And as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I\u2019m <a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/timincafe-scaled.jpeg\">currently</a> using the AVP in a coffee shop, which is officially <a href=\"https://x.com/waitbutwhy/status/1755672453999710482?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">embarrassing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>   For some odd reason, you can\u2019t open multiple desktops (yet), but you <em>can </em>open some of the things on your desktop as their own apps in separate windows. There\u2019s an AVP iMessage app, so I closed iMessage on my desktop and opened it in an adjacent window. I often remotely cowork with Alicia (WBW\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things), putting her in a little window in the corner of my screen. Now, she\u2019s in her own window. If I\u2019m willing to bite the bullet and switch from Chrome to Safari, I can pull my research and web browsing off the desktop too. The end result is that a single small, immobile computer screen has been replaced with a giant mosaic of screens, for the small price of having a snorkeling mask on my face all day. It kind of feels like you stepped into your computer screen, into the beautiful wallpaper landscape, amongst the windows. Very surreal. I wrote this entire post in the headset and have found myself enjoying writing more\u2014and being more focused\u2014than normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>My overall feelings</strong>\n</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The best way I can describe how I feel about the Vision Pro is a strange combination of utterly thunderstruck and mildly underwhelmed. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The magical interface, the giant screens, the immersive experiences\u2014they\u2019re just unfathomably cool and awe-inspiring. It feels like a sneak peek at the 2030s.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But after a couple of days, I found myself thinking, \u201cIs that\u2026it?\u201d I had done the small handful of immersive experiences, played some of the small selection of games, looked at a bunch of my panoramic photos, and tried avatar FaceTime\u2014and at the moment, there\u2019s just not that much else to do in the Vision Pro.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first iPhone left me feeling the same combination of blown away and bored. The phone and I had a torrid honeymoon, but after the novelty of the interface wore off, all it had to offer was the same 16 practical apps.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/iphone-os1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"259\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/iphone-os1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10493\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  There was no app store yet, it dropped calls constantly, and the cellular internet (which you couldn\u2019t use while on a call) was painfully slow. The iPhone wasn\u2019t a world-changing device yet. It was the seed from which a world-changing device would grow.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  If you zoom out on a story of technology, you usually see a big exponential curve.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1187\" height=\"1124\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10487\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1.png 1187w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-600x568.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-750x710.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-1-768x727.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1187px) 100vw, 1187px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  But if you look at the curve up close, you see that it\u2019s wavy, made of S-curves.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1249\" height=\"1124\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10488\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2.png 1249w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-600x540.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-750x675.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-2-768x691.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1249px) 100vw, 1249px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The first iPhone was such a big deal because it launched a new S. Investors had a new place to pour their money. Developers had a new place to pour their efforts. Creators had a new place to pour their talents. As millions of human hours worked on the collective human project, the next five years were a whirlwind of innovation and excitement. Apple\u2019s keynotes became a must-watch for anyone interested in tech, as each jump between the iPhone 1 &gt; 3G &gt; 3GS &gt; 4 &gt; 4S &gt; 5 was a major leap in hardware and software. It was the steep part of the S.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1121\" height=\"986\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10489\" style=\"width:500px\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3.png 1121w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-600x528.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-750x660.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/S-Curves-3-768x676.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Then, the keynotes got boring. The changes were incremental. Apple stopped innovating and started refining. This coincided with Tim Cook taking over, but it isn\u2019t his fault. The steep part of the S-curve doesn\u2019t go on forever, and companies often reap the biggest rewards in the boring, top part of the S once the industry matures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Maybe the reason VR has been slow to take off isn\u2019t because there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong with VR. Maybe it\u2019s because, for the last decade, we\u2019ve been working our way through the very early part of the VR S-curve\u2014the slow part where foundational technology is researched and built. My Vision Pro is highly imperfect\u2014overpriced, heavy, slightly glitchy, very limited, creepy-avatared\u2014because that\u2019s exactly what products are like at the bottom of the S. Consumer products aren\u2019t ready for mass adoption during this stage. But it\u2019s the breakthroughs made during these years that set the stage for the explosive exponential phase of the curve.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The lesson from past VR hype cycles is to temper expectations. The VR S-Curve explosion may be many years away or never come at all. But the lesson from past Apple launches is don\u2019t bet against Apple, and Apple\u2019s bet is that the Vision Pro could be a seed like the first iPhone\u2014a platform for innovation that kicks a new S-curve into high gear.<a href=\"#footnote-4-10470\" id=\"note-4-10470\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a>  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vision Pro, V2 &#8211; V10</strong>\n</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  For someone to regularly use a piece of technology, the benefits have to outweigh the costs. Right now, the Vision Pro benefits are probably less than the costs.\n</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1154\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10526\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:708px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1.png 1154w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1-600x396.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1-750x495.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scale-1-768x506.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>   I\u2019ve already paid for mine, which removes one of the costs, and it\u2019s <em>still </em>a question to what extent I\u2019ll choose it over my computer in the long run. In that regard, the AVP might currently be more like those <a href=\"https://www.seeclearfield.com/assets/images/blogs/bag-phone.jpg\">first cell phones</a> you had to carry around with a briefcase than the first iPhone. Would you get a cell phone if the only way they came was attached a briefcase? Maybe, but it\u2019s a close call. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  For VR to achieve mass adoption, the good needs to be better and the bad needs to be less bad. It\u2019s easy to imagine a pathway to both.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  The operating system will get better each year. The two-finger pinch is currently the only gesture. More will be added. Eventually, there may be dozens of ways to make gestures with our fingers, each one a different command, like today\u2019s keyboard shortcuts. When you spend ten minutes setting up an elaborate configuration of windows, you\u2019ll be able to save (and share) it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Avatars will go from uncanny valley to indistinguishable from your normal face. When you go into immersive environments, you can currently see only your hands. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to identify other objects to remain visible (like a coffee mug). The environments around you will expand from the six current options to hundreds, including delightful fantasy worlds, and they\u2019ll be interactive, allowing you to change things like the weather.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   The hardware will get continually smaller and more comfortable. The resolution and frame rate will become as advanced as the latency. The battery will get way better. So will the look from the outside: to people in the room, the headset will come to look totally transparent. (My personal fantasy: The computer itself becomes detachable, allowing the headset to be a light, sleek, cool-looking visor. The computer and battery snap together into something the size of a smartphone. You\u2019ll be able to snap it to the back of your visor if you don\u2019t want the cord, but most people will prefer the weight to be somewhere other than their heads. The computer/battery rectangle will also have a screen and function as a smartphone for times when you want to do something with the visor off. The visor will fold neatly onto the rectangle to make the whole thing a single compact object.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Finally, the amount of content, applications, and experiences will multiply by 1,000-fold, just like the apps in the app store did from 2008 to today. There will be a wide array of immersive games and entertainment. People will watch sports from one of many vantage points on the field, sideline, stands, or overhead\u2014next to their friends, who will be able to look at each other and talk as well as if they were actually together in person. Pop stars will play in front of 50,000 people in person and 5 million people virtually. Fitness will become fun, interactive, and social. The best teachers and coaches will reach millions of people. Amazing AI teachers could reach billions. Distance will melt away, allowing people to spend high-quality time with their loved ones, no matter where they are. People who couldn\u2019t dream of traveling the world today will get to enjoy vivid experiences anywhere on the globe. Of course, my silly 2024 imagination can\u2019t scratch the surface any more than people in the briefcase phone days could have predicted Uber, TikTok, or Tinder.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n  Over time, the price will come down, with some companies making headsets dirt cheap the way they have for smartphones today. As the value proposition gets better and better, more people will have them, enhancing the social component and eradicating any stigma. Mass adoption seems like a very real future possibility.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>   I know what many of you are thinking: A world where everyone is in VR headsets (or visors, or glasses, or contact lenses) sounds<em> </em>dystopian and <a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/goldblum.jpg\">awful</a>.

Just two weeks after the book launch, my first baby would be born. I\u2019d promote the book, catch my breath, and then begin the new adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank god for those critical two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The night before book launch was (obviously) a frantic all-nighter, and I eventually went to bed after 40 hours awake, exhausted and satisfied. We had done it. The book was live. It was over. I\u2019d actually wake up tomorrow without this project hanging over my head. The sky would be blue. I\u2019d finally be free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I woke up close to noon and felt at peace for three seconds before opening my phone and seeing three texts from my wife:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10204\" width=\"481\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke.png 1167w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-600x222.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-750x277.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01_water-broke-768x284.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew what water breaking was. But I didn\u2019t know what it meant. Is the baby coming out now? Or was this one of the false alarms I had heard about and the baby is still a couple weeks away? Is there a chance she just peed her pants and is misdiagnosing the situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After some rapid-fire googling, one thing was clear: We had to go to the hospital. Now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drive was weird. I had pictured myself heroically driving a screaming labor-having wife to the hospital, but here I was driving normally to the hospital with a very normal wife next to me. Apart from her new leaking situation, nothing was different than it was yesterday. There was no way we were actually having a baby today. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon arrival, the PA assessed things and yes her water had broken, and yes in order to avoid infection that meant the baby had to come out now. Two hours and 12 canceled book-promoting podcasts later, we\u2019re in our delivery room, where my still-not-in-labor wife would supposedly be producing a baby sometime later today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, there was a major expectations-reality gap. I had pictured the day of my first child\u2019s birth being impossibly frenetic and emotional and intense. But there we were, eating animal crackers and gummies from the treats-you-can-eat-while-in-labor bag, hanging out and chatting like any other day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife was hooked up to a bunch of tubes and machines and the plan was to see if contractions would start on their own as a reaction to her water breaking, but a few hours passed and nothing happened.

Babies are cute and roly-poly and can see and are conscious and are normal and a newborn is not any of these things. It is a bizarre human larva that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CqWS89MAE-5/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acts super weird</a> and would still be in the womb if it could be. The problem is, when humans went bipedal, our pelvises got smaller, and as humans got smarter, our heads got bigger. So evolution had to get creative. Its solution: all human babies would be premies, born when they were still small enough to pass through a human pelvis. The last couple months as a fetus would happen outside the womb, and everyone would just have to deal with that. This became incredibly obvious during the first month with my daughter. She was a raw human id not remotely ready for primetime. Thankfully, since then, a baby has grown around the id and now she has the figure of a miniature 390-pound 84-year-old woman.<a href=\"#footnote-1-10203\" id=\"note-1-10203\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) It is insane that there\u2019s not some required training for new-parents-to-be</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to drive a car, I have to take driver\u2019s ed first. If I want to provide medical advice, I have to go to med school first. But after we had the baby, the hospital was like \u201cdon\u2019t shake it k bye.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know a lot of words I didn\u2019t used to know. Meconium. Tummy time. Latching. Bicycling. Swaddle. Colostrum. I know how many ounces of milk and hours of sleep the baby is supposed to have each day. I know baby CPR and the baby Heimlich maneuver. I know how to induce baby burps and shits. I know how warmly to dress a baby. I know what temperature baby bathwater should be. I know what sleep training is and when it\u2019s okay to start it. I know that you can\u2019t just pick a newborn up, you have to pick all the pieces up at the same time or else the pieces fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/08_pieces.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10213\" width=\"374\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/08_pieces.png 748w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/08_pieces-600x526.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But I only know all of these things because I read books and articles and am fortunate to have people I can call with questions.</em> And society\u2019s current plan is to just expect/hope that every new parent does the same??

I could squish her face, but then she\u2019d cry and I\u2019d be abusing a baby. In the early weeks, there\u2019s just not really a satisfying outlet for your baby fondness and it\u2019s annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other one-sided thing is you\u2019re apparently supposed to talk to your newborn even though they\u2019re an unconscious fetus because it supposedly helps develop their brain. So now my baby has heard multiple versions of my next book outline, the full story of the rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire after I listened to a podcast about it, and a list of every World Series champion going back to 1990. Never once has the baby shown any sign of being affected by any of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*That said, I\u2019ve always thought of parental love as the most intense form of love\u2014the kind where if you had a Sophie\u2019s choice where your baby and spouse were both hanging off a cliff and you could only save one, you\u2019d save the baby without a second thought. And\u2026yeah I\u2019m not there yet. I love this little creature a freakish amount, but as of now, I\u2019m definitely saving my wife in that situation. Sorry kiddo. I\u2019m sure Tim the Baby-Saver-Wife-Dropper will at some point emerge, but I guess it takes some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6) <strong>Babies shit all over your schedule</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obvious one, I know, but just check this out:<a href=\"#footnote2-1-10203\" id=\"note2-1-10203\" rel=\"footnote2\">1</a>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/13_sleep-graph-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/13_sleep-graph-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10211\" width=\"700\" height=\"460\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/14_sleep-graph-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/14_sleep-graph-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10218\" width=\"700\" height=\"279\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-750x242.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10219\" width=\"700\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-750x242.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-600x194.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-768x248.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-1536x495.png 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/15_sleep-graph-3-2048x661.png 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the sleep graphs of three different babies, but they all have one thing in common: there\u2019s no rhyme or reason in the early months, because newborns are dicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7) It\u2019s mathematically impossible to know if your baby is cute or not</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my baby is impossibly adorable, of course, but every parent thinks that about their baby, so that offers no information.

They\u2019re terrible at thinking, at knowing anything, at moving all parts of their body. The cool thing is that spending time with a super unimpressive baby has made me super impressed by myself. Like I\u2019ll watch the baby sitting in a <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/9797/0008/products/Babybjorn-Toy-Bar-Image-2_1400x.jpg?v=1556318117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">baby bouncer</a> trying to reach for a little wooden flower one foot in front of her and she just flings her arm in the general direction and misses by a lot. Then I\u2019ll reach for a glass of water and all of my joints work together to send my hand on a perfectly straight path through three-dimensional space, gracefully clasp my fingers around it using the perfect amount of pressure, raise it to my mouth, tilt it in perfect sync with the movement of my lips, and then return the glass to the table and gently place it down like an absolute genius.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9) You don\u2019t go from a non-parent to a parent overnight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things are just too big for our little human brains to fully absorb. The bigness of the universe. The permanence of death. The magnitude of the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/09/marriage-decision.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marriage decision</a>, which I <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">once described</a> like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When you choose a life partner, you\u2019re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you\u2019ll hear about 18,000 times. Intense shit.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months into fatherhood, this feels like another item in that category. When your baby is born, you will (hopefully) never live another day as a non-parent. For people who make the decision to do this, it is the BC-AD line of their life. It doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still be you, but you are trading in one kind of life for another, with all of the pros and cons that come along with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to quite wrap my head around the bigness of the situation. A curious childless friend asked me the other day if I feel like a dad, and I surprised myself by answering \u201cnot really.\u201d I mostly feel like old me that has this new delightful little thing living in my house. When I see friends with sentient kids actually parenting them, saying things like \u201cthat\u2019s not nice, stop it,\u201d whatever that must be like is as much of a mystery to me as it was three months ago. For me at least, it seems like a parent is something you slowly turn into as your first baby slowly turns into a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Btw I\u2019m now even more convinced than I was before that this is the most personal of personal decisions and no one should ever try to pressure anyone else to have kids\u2014it\u2019s way too big a thing to be anyone else\u2019s business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10) Having a baby really makes you think about the future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every parent in history has brought their baby into a world with an uncertain future. But our future is the uncertainest. My baby might live a life a lot like mine, just a little more futuristic. Or she might live to 500. She might live most of her life with a <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">brain-machine interface</a> implanted in her head, thinking with her own superintelligent AI. She might suffer through civilizational collapse. She might live in a world that would seem like utopia to us today. She might live on Mars. She might meet aliens. She might die in the apocalypse. There\u2019s just no way to know. It makes all of those fun, exciting, terrifying conversations about the future hit just a little harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a

whatsourproblem https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=9513 <p>On June 18, 2016, I slipped and fell down a deep, deep hole.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/02/last-six-years.html\">A Short History of My Last Six Years</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> <p>June 18, 2016. Obama was president, the Cavs were on their way to beating the Warriors in the NBA finals, Game of Thrones was still good, and I was 34 years old with my whole life ahead of me.</p>\n<p>Wait But Why had been around for three years, a stretch during which I wrote about 100 blog posts on dozens of topics. On the afternoon of June 18, 2016, I was sitting on the couch engaging in a familiar ritual: looking through my list of future post ideas, trying to pick my next topic. And then I had a thought.</p>\n<p>So many of the post ideas I was scanning through were about the future. Virtual reality. Artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering. Life extension. Multiplanetary expansion. But lately, it felt like there was a cloud hanging over all these topics.</p>\n<p>My urge to write about the future comes from an excited optimism that\u2019s fundamental to my personality. I believe at a deep level that the future is going to be an amazing, exhilarating ride, and nothing is more fun than learning about cutting edge developments that can offer clues into what magic might lie down the road.</p>\n<p>But on June 18, 2016, I didn\u2019t feel excitedly optimistic. There was a different feel to the world than there had been in my previous blogging years. Something seemed <em>off</em> about the society around me, like there had been a subtle, foreboding shift in the balance between reason and madness. It felt like we were losing our grip on something important.</p>\n<p>The fun thing about being a blogger is you can write about whatever the fuck you want. And a good compass for me had always been that if something was incessantly on my mind, it was probably a good post topic. So I decided to write what I call a \u201cmini post.\u201d</p>\n<p>Wait But Why articles are long, and they go deep. I bathe in the topic for a little while, dread writing it for a little while, then finally pump it out, draw the drawings, give it a read, and post. A mini-post is much chiller\u2014I just open WordPress and type what\u2019s on my mind, and post it.</p>\n<p>So I opened WordPress to write a little post about that cloud I felt hovering over my other post topics. I\u2019d knock out a draft tonight, give it a read tomorrow, and publish it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9515\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"532\" height=\"114\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1.png 2002w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-600x129.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-750x161.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-768x165.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-1-1536x329.png 1536w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px\" /></a></p>\n<p>But nothing came out. I didn\u2019t know where to start.</p>\n<p>There were a bunch of bad trends: Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. But <em>why </em>was all of this happening now? Was the problem related to social media? To politics or current events? Was it some broader cultural or psychological phenomenon?</p>\n<p>I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t feeling the normal confidence I felt when I started a new post. Something about this topic felt <em>scary</em>. I never felt scared to write about anything before. This fear of writing about this topic seemed like it was an important <em>part </em>of the topic.</p>\n<p>Nope. Not a mini-post. I needed the full week for this one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9514\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"110\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2.png 2275w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-600x113.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-750x141.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-768x145.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-1536x290.png 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Days-2-2048x386.png 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></a></p>\n<p>But a funny thing happened that week. I didn\u2019t write anything. Instead, I started jotting down notes and ideas in a Text Edit document called \u201csociety\u201d that quickly became long and messy. I abandoned that document and opened up \u201csociety 2\u201d to give myself a fresh start. Soon there was a Society folder with seven note documents.</p>\n<p>I could have just stopped there. Too big a topic, too out of my wheelhouse, too icky, too scary. An outline for a virtual reality post was sitting right there in my Future Posts folder waiting for me.</p>\n<p>But I\u2019m really, really bad with the sunk cost fallacy. I had already put so much time and thought in, and I couldn\u2019t handle all of it being for nothing.</p>\n<p>And so began the next six years of my life.</p>\n<p>I wish I could say that I actively decided to put everything else aside and write a giant opus on the problems with my society. But it didn\u2019t happen like that. If you asked me at any point over the past six years when I was gonna be done with my society post\u2014and plenty of people did\u2014the answer was always, \u201cI\u2019m finally getting close.\u201d And I believed it every time. I fully believed, every time, that this thing was almost done. The delusion of a madman.</p>\n<p>And the problem with this particular delusion is that it\u2019s a perfect way to ruin your life. If I believed I was working on a six-year project, I\u2019d have worked the project into my normal life. I\u2019d get into a rhythm that would allow for a work-life balance. But when you think you\u2019re at <em>most</em> a couple months from finishing a big project, it makes sense to put everything else on hold for just a little bit more until the project is done. I wasn\u2019t someone who never made fun plans or who worked on every vacation or who took a lot of Vyvanse\u2014I was someone who did those things just for right now, because I\u2019m in crunch time on a big project. For six years.</p>\n<p>In May of 2017, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. We had been dating since 2011. She had seen the whole Wait But Why journey up close and had now been living with \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this big project\u201d Tim for a year. We set our wedding date for October of 2018. Thank god by then I\u2019d be out of this pit and working on all kinds of other fun projects.</p>\n<p>But instead of the project wrapping up, it just got bigger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9518\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"588\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls.png 2320w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-600x347.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-750x433.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-768x444.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-1536x887.png 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Three-balls-2048x1183.png 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The topic had led me down dozens of totally different rabbit holes, and everything I read seemed relevant to it. I don&#8217;t like telling a partial story. Like I had in other posts, I was determined to tell the full, full story. If I noticed something in my reading or on social media or in the news that seemed like an important piece of the puzzle, it had to be incorporated. If that fucked up the current outline, then the outline would have to adapt.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the outlines became ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t keep it all in my head at once, so I made sub-outlines, and sub-sub-outlines. The Society folder now looked like this:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong> <a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9525\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"312\" height=\"1164\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2.png 718w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-161x600.png 161w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-201x750.png 201w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-412x1536.png 412w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Documents-2-549x2048.png 549w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>As 2017 became 2018, I decided that the wedding would be the hard deadline that I needed.

The way to proceed was obvious. I should pick a piece of this albatross, throw the rest away, and focus in on it.

They tried encouraging me, shaming me, setting deadlines for me, reminding me that one post really shouldn\u2019t take multiple years. Nothing seemed to help.</p>\n<p>Finally, in mid-2019, I hatched a plan that would once and for all end this thing. Rather than post a gargantuan blog post, I\u2019d make it a <em>series</em>. This would break it into parts, which is less daunting. Plus, I had learned that the adrenaline of knowing that my readers were only days away from seeing what I was working on was a huge motivator that I had been sorely missing.</p>\n<p>I called it <em>The Story of Us</em> and in August of 2019, the first chapter went up. The whole thing would be 12 chapters, I decided, and even though the chapters got longer as they went, and the time between them expanded, it was finally happening\u2014I was <em>publishing </em>the damn thing. The end was near.</p>\n<p>Then came Chapter 11. The first 10 chapters had introduced the core framework of the series and talked broadly about the big picture of what I thought our problem was. In Chapter 11, I was going to dip into more controversial territory, looking at the past few years of news stories through the lens of the framework we had developed.</p>\n<p>It turns out I had a lot more to say about what was going on around me than I had anticipated. Soon, my draft of Chapter 11 was longer than the first ten chapters combined. I have problems.</p>\n<p>Now it was the middle of 2020. Covid was in full swing. Thousands of people were marching by my apartment in protest. It was a seismic year for American society. Everything I was writing about was happening, and rapidly evolving, literally outside my window. What I had written months earlier suddenly seemed stale. Also, Chapter 11 was over 100,000 words. Death.</p>\n<p>It started to dawn on me that I really needed to just turn this into a book. Between the mountains of feedback I had gotten from readers and friends on <em>The Story of Us </em>and the mountains of new thoughts I had about all the recent developments in the world, I knew that there was one way to really bring the project from hell home: open a blank Microsoft Word document and write a newer, better, <em>complete </em>story, and do it in a book format that people could read more easily than a web page. Somewhere, a fairy died.</p>\n<p>So I started writing the book. I\u2019d call it the name it should have always been called: <em>What\u2019s Our Problem? </em>I knew what I wanted to say. I just had to write it.</p>\n<p>I finished V1 in December of 2021 and triumphantly tweeted about it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9526\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet.png 934w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-600x220.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-750x275.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Tweet-768x281.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Done! In a sense! It was 250,000 words, which is about 150,000 words too long. And missing most of the drawings. And I had a giant \u201cADD IN\u201d document full of news stories which had happened in the year and a half since I started writing the book that would need to be incorporated.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to cut writing. Perfectionism, sunk costs, etc. Procrastination abound. I would try to cut a section down, polish it off, and move on, but kept finding myself rewriting the section entirely. I was moving at a snail\u2019s pace.</p>\n<p>Then one day in June of 2022, my wife woke me up by handing me a positive pregnancy stick. It was a surreal, joyful moment. I\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s dad before but always wanted to be. Then the thought hit me.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9516\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"355\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby.png 814w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby-480x600.png 480w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby-600x750.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Baby-768x960.png 768w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p>NOPE. 100% no.

I\u2019m very proud of the final product and never want to have an experience like this again.</p>\n<p>If you would like to take my last six years and put it into your brain, here are the different options (all available on Tuesday Feb 21):</p>\n<p><strong>Ebook: </strong>Available on most major platforms (you can also buy the EPUB directly). It looks best on color e-readers and tablets (especially on vertical scroll mode), but also fine on phones and black-and-white e-readers. The best ebook experience we\u2019ve seen is Apple Books &gt; iPad &gt; sepia &gt; vertical scroll. Available for preorder on <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/whats-our-problem/id6445642236\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Apple</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Our-Problem-Self-Help-Societies-ebook/dp/B0BTJCTR58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Kindle</strong></a> \u2013 the rest are available on launch day, Feb 21.</p>\n<p><strong>Wait But Why: </strong>Without the limitations of the other formats, this is where the drawings can be displayed full-size, where footnotes can be interactive, etc. The downside here is that you can only read it on a tablet or phone, not an e-reader, and there\u2019s no dark mode at the moment. Available <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wop\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshots-medium-scaled.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click here to see how the book looks in different formats</strong></a></h4>\n<p><strong>Audiobook: </strong>Available on most major platforms (or you can buy the mp3 directly). Read painstakingly by me. I personally do most of my reading via audiobook, so I tried to make it the best possible experience. The obvious downside is that the book has 300+ visuals, so we made a webpage (and pdf) for audiobook listeners with the 46 most important drawings, numbered. When I get to that point in the reading, I say something like, \u201cGo look at drawing number 24.\u201d Available for preorder on <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/audiobook/what-s-our-problem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Kobo</strong></a> and on other platforms (Audible, Apple, Spotify, and more) on launch day.</p>\n<p><strong>If you can\u2019t afford it: </strong>I really want everyone who wants to read this book to be able to do so, so if you can\u2019t afford to buy the book, email us at <a href=\"mailto:whatsourproblem@waitbutwhy.com\">whatsourproblem@waitbutwhy.com</a> and we\u2019ll give you a code that lets you read it on WBW for free.</p>\n<p><strong>Print: </strong><s>There is not a print version, which I know will disappoint some people.

Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of germs out there. A smaller germ, like the virus that causes covid, is 120nm across. The smallest object we can see is about 0.1mm\u2014about the width of a human hair. You&#8217;d have to line up about 800 coronaviruses to get to 0.1mm\u2014but that would be a one-dimensional line way too thin to see. To actually see something, you&#8217;d have to give it some <i>area </i>and turn the 800-virus line into an 800 x 800 square.

Zachary is 7, so let&#8217;s estimate his mass at 25 kg. That means the bacteria in his body adds up to 75 grams\u2014about the weight of a plum.

(Athens, Greece)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many films are the most fun the first time because a part of our brains loses itself in the plot and actually experiences what the characters are experiencing, to an extent. Part of why that&#8217;s so fun is the uncertainty, which makes it like a real-life adventure. Once we know what&#8217;s going to happen, the experience is less exciting for the same reason an adventure would be less exciting if you already knew how everything was gonna play out.</p>\n<p>A song works the opposite way. Not knowing where the song is going can be intellectually interesting, but what our brain really wants to do is mentally <i>dance </i>with the song, and it can&#8217;t do that if it doesn&#8217;t know the &#8220;steps.&#8221; That&#8217;s why a catchy song is only okay the first time but it can quickly become orgasmic after we hear it a few times and our brains get the hang of it. Once our brain memorizes a song, the song has a special pathway carved in our heads and it feels great to light that pathway up by hearing the song (and if we don&#8217;t give our brain the chance, it might just start lighting up the pathway itself, and the song gets &#8220;stuck in your head&#8221;).<a href=\"#footnote-4-9079\" id=\"note-4-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a>\n<p>Back to films, the thing is, a film isn&#8217;t <em>just </em>a plot.

No SIM card, not signed into iCloud, no apps except Kindle, iBooks, Downcast (podcasts), NYT Crosswords, YouTube, and some practical ones (alarm, calendar, notes and voice recorder for those morning insights). Then I leave my real phone in a different room, as far away and inconveniently located as possible. This has been pretty groundbreaking for me. I find that I actually look forward to saying bye to my normal phone and transitioning to the bed phone stage of the night.

I have certain moments when I&#8217;m actually talking to myself in my head, but I find that 90% of the time my head is up in the clouds (which is most of the time) I have a lot of thoughts going on but no specific <i>words </i>in my head. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s what everyone is like or if I&#8217;m weird. The reason I wonder about it is that when people explain why you should meditate, they say something like, &#8220;it&#8217;s important to quiet the constant &#8216;chatter&#8217; in your head.&#8221; And I always wonder whether &#8220;chatter&#8221; is just the word they&#8217;re using for the constant stream of thoughts or if there is actually a <i>voice </i>to those thoughts in most people&#8217;s head but not mine. Someone tell me what&#8217;s up.</p>\n<p>Anyway I get your bigger point, Malaika, and I&#8217;m with you, but I don&#8217;t have a good answer beyond something obvious like &#8220;try meditation!&#8221;

A typical blue whale is about 15 times the length of a human and around 2,500 times the mass. A human compared to microbes is many orders of magnitude larger. We\u2019re less big amongst mammals, but even there we\u2019re bigger than we are small. A human is about 35 times the length of the smallest mammal\u2014the adorable <a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mailbag-2_bumblebee-bat.jpeg\"><u>bumblebee bat</u></a>\u2014and 40,000 times more massive.</p>\n<p>Moving beyond the realm of biology\u2014if we consider ourselves in relation to well-understood <i>objects</i>, we might make our endpoints a proton (10<sup>-16</sup>m) and the sun (10<sup>8</sup>m), in which case we&#8217;re much closer to the size of the sun than the size of a proton. Big again. But if we use the Milky Way (10<sup>20</sup>m) as our upper endpoint, then we become smaller than we are big.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the whole range of size. According to my <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/universe-in-a-nutshell-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Universe in a Nutshell</a> app (plug!), the smallest known unit of space, the Planck length (maybe our universe&#8217;s pixel size), is about 10<sup>-35</sup>m. The largest space we can see is the observable universe, which is around 10<sup>26</sup>m range. If those are our endpoints, the midpoint between them would be a bit smaller than the width of a human hair\u2014making us bigger than we are small.</p>\n<p>But the observable universe is probably only a tiny piece of the full universe, and then there&#8217;s the multiverse if that&#8217;s a thing. So the real upper endpoint is probably high enough, if it exists at all, to make us much smaller than we are big.</p>\n<p>My takeaway here is that we&#8217;re extremely middling when it comes to size, which I guess isn&#8217;t the worst thing to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How do I get over a breakup if I&#8217;m still in love?</strong> \u2013 <em>Anon</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no way to make an excruciating loss not excruciating except time, and I&#8217;m sorry to hear about the excruciatingness you&#8217;re going through.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;ll help to remember that everyone you know, everyone you see on the street, everyone who&#8217;s ever lived in every place and time, has probably been there too or will be there in the future\u2014because excruciating loss is an unfortunate staple of the human experience.</p>\n<p>It might also help to remember that the part of you that feels like this wound will never heal is almost definitely wrong, and being wrong about that is also a staple of the human experience.

It was on a friend named Lucy. He told me to put the phone away and concentrate on the name.

(New York, NY)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>NYC is an extreme place. It&#8217;s great at being exceptional and it&#8217;s great at being awful. It&#8217;s a high-priced filth bucket with great weather 25% of the time. It&#8217;s supposedly this world-leading city and yet it&#8217;s often behind the innovation curve and feels less futuristic than many other cities. The restaurants are world-class but it can also sometimes be hard to find a fresh salad for lunch. I could go on.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also a place where within a 20-minute walk of my apartment I can find every cuisine in the world, every type of art, every kind of shop, and a million different cultural experiences (many in secret underground nooks). It feels like the entire <i>world</i> is crammed into this city.</p>\n<p>Among US cities, it&#8217;s not #1 for tech (SF), entertainment (LA), politics (DC), medicine (Boston), or a handful of other major industries. But it&#8217;s at least top 5 in <i>every </i>industry. NYC has <i>breadth </i>like nowhere else I know (at least in the US). This is especially appealing to me since I like to dig into a lot of totally different areas with my writing.</p>\n<p>On a me-specific level, it&#8217;s a place where a large portion of my friends and acquaintances live, and of those who don&#8217;t live here, a large portion come through the city at least once a year. Nowhere other than NYC would I be able to get this level of in-person contact with such a large percentage of people I care about. (It&#8217;s also a quick trip to Boston, where much of my family lives.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I really like the historical aspect. 300 years of human ingenuity gives a place a lot of character (I know that sounds paltry to non-Americans but it&#8217;s a big deal here!). Every street has an epic story to it. It makes the city like a big history museum to explore, and I like knowing that I&#8217;ll never even scratch the surface.</p>\n<p>The awful things about NYC suck. A lot. But for me at least, the good things make living here a clear net positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>How are you?

(Delhi, India)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think in most cases, we should feel fine loving the art we love, regardless of who the artist is, what they did, or what they believed. John Lennon was physically abusive in his early relationships. Picasso and Jackson Pollock were abusive husbands. Walt Disney wasn&#8217;t a fan of the Jews, nor is Cat Stevens. Ellen DeGeneres was a dick to her staff. Norman Mailer stabbed his wife. I could have listed 1,000 of these because artists are often messed up, unstable people who do or say bad things (and because <i>most</i> people secretly hold deep-down beliefs you would disapprove of if you knew about them). That a lot of great art emerges from troubled minds shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise or invalidate the art as great art to be enjoyed\u2014at least not to me.</p>\n<p>In many cases, we&#8217;re also talking about artists who lived in different times\u2014times when your own ancestors who lived then almost certainly were doing or saying some things that would make them &#8220;bad people&#8221; by today&#8217;s standards.</p>\n<p>For those who generally agree with me about this, there might still be exceptions. Maybe an important <i>part </i>of why you liked <em>The Cosby Show</em> was the belief that Bill Cosby really was a lot like Cliff Huxtable, and knowing what you know now, the show loses its charm. I just find those to be the rare exceptions, not the rule.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would say there are two okay views to have here: 1) my view, that you can enjoy art by people you disapprove of, and 2) the opposite view, that not liking the artist ruins the art. What&#8217;s not an okay view is 3) &#8220;Art by a person I disapprove of should be banned so that <i>no </i>one is allowed to consume it, and any platform that doesn&#8217;t ban it should be punished.&#8221; There&#8217;s way too much #3 going on right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What countries were your absolute favorite travel experiences?</strong> \u2013<em>&nbsp;Samantha K.

Once that happens, your <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html\">Primitive Mind</a> enters the equation and will do whatever possible to keep you from changing your mind, which cripples your ability to learn. Keeping your identity small is hugely liberating, and a lot less stressful. When your identity is small, you have nothing to cling onto and you can just relax and explore. So start by doing a self-audit and figuring out which ideas you&#8217;ve come to hold sacred\u2014we all do this, it&#8217;s human\u2014and remind yourself that they&#8217;re just ideas, they&#8217;re not you.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What are your favorite <strong>podcasts</strong>?</strong> \u2013<em> Laura B.

(New York, NY)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met Chris Anderson, the head of TED, in 2015. He had read a few WBW posts and offered me the opportunity to give a TED Talk at the 2016 conference (which was six months away). Immediately full of both gratitude/excitement and dread/anxiety, I asked him if it might be better to wait a couple years until I had some more speaking experience. He paused thoughtfully for a few seconds before saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s no time like the present.&#8221; I took his advice. Since then, his voice saying those words has popped into my head again and again during hard decisions, and I&#8217;m yet to regret following them.</p>\n<p>Great advice is sometimes great because it&#8217;s totally original or framed in an original way. But, as in my story, a well-known platitude, at the perfect <i>moment</i>, can also make a huge impact. What makes Chris&#8217;s advice so valuable to me wasn&#8217;t that it was something new\u2014it was that the lesson I learned from <i>taking</i> the advice in that particular moment turned a clich\u00e9 into a mantra.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What are your thoughts on TikTok?</strong> \u2013 <em>Annie (Ontario, California)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time, TikTok was this impossibly annoying-seeming thing that wouldn&#8217;t go away.

You&#8217;re a full &#8220;thing&#8221; everywhere you go and everyone would flip out, but then they&#8217;d get used to it and you could still have an almost normal life. You could still have an almost normal house. You could for sure play in the NBA. You could still have sex.</p>\n<p>No one is fucking a nine-inch tall person. And you couldn&#8217;t go anywhere without everyone you&#8217;re about to see being fully prepped ahead of time for the situation. Your house would be a joke. That said, there would be benefits. You could sneak into anything and hide very easily. Like you could probably smuggle yourself on a plane to Russia without anyone noticing, sneak into the Kremlin, and listen in on the most secretive Putin meetings while hiding behind the curtains or somewhere. But then what?</p>\n<p>So I guess my answer is that the nine-inch-tall option would be very fun for a while but then when you got bored of the perks, you&#8217;d be confronted with your life as a pencil person and would probably regret the choice. So I&#8217;d go with 11 feet tall.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Can you suggest methods for dealing with the crushing realization that people you used to have a lot of respect for don&#8217;t hold the principles/values you thought they did and therefore might no longer be worthy of your respect?

The better I get to know people I&#8217;ve previously lionized, the more disappointed I become. This makes sense, because people are neither demons nor angels\u2014they&#8217;re humans. The crushing realization you&#8217;re experiencing is probably less some awful truths you&#8217;re learning about people you admire and more a truth you&#8217;re seeing about humans in general. Even the people you look up to are fallible and flawed\u2014but that doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t also be worthy of your love and respect.</p>\n<p>With all that in mind, I&#8217;d consider three things:</p>\n<p>First, take a hard look at ways you feel these people are disappointing you, and try asking whether your own judgments might be off. On more than one occasion, I&#8217;ve scoffed at those I once considered wise only to later realize that they weren&#8217;t all that wrong after all.</p>\n<p>Second, think about <i>all </i>the ways a human can be good and wise, and you&#8217;ll be reminded of certain ways these people are still very much worthy of your admiration. Focusing on those areas can restore the respect you want to feel towards them.</p>\n<p>Finally, where you do firmly believe you have something right that they don&#8217;t, remember that wisdom is a multi-generational collaboration. When mentorship works, it raises mentees to be <i>wiser</i> than the mentor\u2014mentees who can then be even better mentors to the next generation. This is how the wisdom trend slopes continually upwards. If your mentors are forever wiser than you, they failed as mentors. So when you do feel wiser, it&#8217;s not a bad thing\u2014it means it&#8217;s your turn to take the wisdom torch and try to bring it to the next level.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>What are your most left-wing, and most right-wing, <strong>political positions</strong>?</strong> \u2013 <em>Hannah J.

And instead of trying to suppress evidence that cigarettes are disastrous for your health, the big alcohol companies need to keep all the other fun drugs stigmatized and illegal\u2014and with tens of billions of dollars at stake, they&#8217;ll spend billions of dollars to keep the status quo the way it is.</p>\n<p>When I grew up, the rules were clear: if a party is a cool party, it has alcohol at it, and if you&#8217;re a cool person, you drink alcohol. If your party doesn&#8217;t have alcohol, it&#8217;s not a cool party, and if you don&#8217;t drink alcohol, you&#8217;re not a cool person. If you take a step back and think about it, that&#8217;s kinda weird. This one particular drug, of so many, has been deemed A) the socially acceptable, non-stigmatized one, and B) the definition of cool. Meanwhile, alcohol is just an alright drug\u2014probably a below average one\u2014while also being one of the<i> </i>most dangerous and harmful ones.

This is about more than the obvious point that doing so literally increases the cumulative time you&#8217;ll talk to them: When you don&#8217;t see someone frequently enough, every time you do hang out ends up being a big catch-up, where both of you update the other on your lives.

They&#8217;re just stuck in a social rut. In this case, all it might take is one person actually starting to say what they really think and being willing to break the &#8220;disagreement&#8221; ice, and the whole relationship can transform into something much more interesting and high rung. Of course, there are plenty of other times when an Echo Chamber dynamic is in place because one or both people very much want it to be that way, and an attempt by one party to snap out of that will go over badly (btw, this isn&#8217;t the end of the world\u2014it just means that high-rung conversation won&#8217;t be a part of that relationship, you can still enjoy the rest of what it has to offer). If you do find that most of your existing relationships are stuck on the intellectual low rungs, you&#8217;ll want to supplement things with some new friendships that can better indulge your intellect. This is where the other two points come in.</p>\n<p><b>2) Collect high-rungers you happen upon in the wild. </b>Post-college-age people tend to be really bad at making new friends. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. There will be moments\u2014at work, at a dinner party, at some event\u2014when you discover a super interesting-seeming person you really like talking to, and you wish you were friends with them. If you feel this way, there&#8217;s a decent chance they feel the same way about you. And if you can fight off your <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mammoth</a> (who is irrationally horrified by the possibility you may put yourself out there and get rejected) and get in the habit of getting their phone number and sending a &#8220;great meeting you! would love to chat again sometime&#8221; text\u2014and then if the response is positive, actually scheduling a coffee or lunch or drink (mammoth: &#8220;but what if they were just being polite!&#8221;), over time you&#8217;ll accumulate a whole new basket of high-rung brains to play with.<a href=\"#footnote-11-9079\" id=\"note-11-9079\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> It&#8217;s <i>really </i>easy to just not put yourself out there for new friendships as an adult, but those who do are usually rewarded.</p>\n<p><b>3) Actively go out looking for high-rungers. </b>This is the ickiest, most amorphous item, and I don&#8217;t have specific suggestions beyond: put yourself in high-rung environments whenever possible. That can mean the place you live, the place you work, the places you spend your free time, the forums you hang out in online, the events you go to.

What are your plans for the future?</strong> \u2013 <em>Kyros J.(Barcelona, Spain)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Here&#8217;s how I think about Patreon, from our side:</b></p>\n<p>Patreon is a means of creative freedom. Without Patreon, money would be a sizable part of our decision-making process. We&#8217;d have to take on sponsorships, sell products, and use paywalls, whether we felt good about it or not. Patreon allows us to do whatever we think actually makes sense for us and what we&#8217;re trying to do. It allows us to make a big list of potential projects and to prioritize them based on what we&#8217;re most excited about and what we think is the most important, not based on what will make the most money. Patreon means that we&#8217;ll do some projects that make money and others that won&#8217;t, and we don&#8217;t have to worry too much about which ones are which. It allows us to start a podcast without a sponsor and have the &#8220;we&#8217;ll get a sponsor if and when it feels right&#8221; attitude. It allows us to turn the Story of Us into a book, because it makes sense in this case, and to have turned down opportunities to make other post series into books, because it wasn&#8217;t something we felt made sense. It allows us to email readers about a product in our store only when we&#8217;re actually excited to tell them about that product. Having money as a secondary concern is an unbelievable creative luxury and one that makes Wait But Why a better place.</p>\n<p><b>Here&#8217;s how I think about Patreon, from your side:</b></p>\n<p>The independent internet creator is a pretty new kind of thing, and I think we&#8217;re all still figuring out the best ways for that to work, financially. Patreon gives regular readers three options:</p>\n<p>1) I like this person&#8217;s work, and I&#8217;d like to pay something for it</p>\n<p>2) I like this person&#8217;s work, and I&#8217;d like to pay something for it, but right now I can&#8217;t afford to</p>\n<p>3) I like this person&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s not something I want to pay for</p>\n<p>The great thing about having a sizable audience is that if a small portion of our readers end up in Category 1, we&#8217;re covered. So far, that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happened. Category 1 readers have combined to be an incredibly<i> </i>important support for us and provide that treasured creative freedom I talked about.</p>\n<p>But that also means that we&#8217;re <i>totally cool </i>with Categories 2 and 3.</p>\n<p>People in Category 2, who would like to support us but don&#8217;t have the budget to spare: not only is that okay, but please know that the last thing I want is for WBW support to be an uncomfortable or stressful expense in your life. I love the idea of WBW being free for people who are only able to consume free content at a given time in their lives.</p>\n<p>People in Category 3, who simply prefer to put their dollars towards other causes, please continue doing so. This is the cool thing about the voluntary donation model\u2014only some people have to do it for it to work perfectly. Category 1 has everyone else covered.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been a Category 1 supporter of ours, huge hug, we love you, and we&#8217;re endlessly grateful. You should also never feel weird or guilty about stopping. Supporting us doesn&#8217;t have to mean supporting us forever. Once a Category 1er, always a Category 1er, no matter when you stop.</p>\n<p>Finally, Patreon is only one way to support WBW. There&#8217;s also buying stuff we sell and, probably most important, sharing WBW with others.</p>\n<p><strong>As for the future of Wait But Why:</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment, it&#8217;s hard to imagine a time when I will want to be doing anything other than creating new things on this platform. My &#8220;future topics list&#8221; is longer than I could ever get through in one life, and as long as I&#8217;m curious, I&#8217;ll be working my way through it.</p>\n<p>Within that broader picture, there are a ton of fun possibilities. We plan to expand the platform from just writing to writing, audio, and video. We want to keep trying new things and new collaborations (like the <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/universe-in-a-nutshell-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app</a> we made with <a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kurzgesagt</a>).

Two teams, everyone writes down names on little slips of paper, folds them and puts them into a big communal bowl (one name on each slip), and each team also has their own empty bowl. You want about 40 names total, so if it&#8217;s a 2-on-2 game, everyone should put 10 names in the bowl each. If it&#8217;s 5-on-5, everyone should do four names. Names can be celebrities, friends of the people playing, or famous fictional characters\u2014you can go a little obscure but you want at least half of the group to know each name. There are three rounds. In the first round, Person 1 on Team A starts &#8211; they have one minute &#8211; they pick a name out of the bowl and say whatever they want (other than stupid cheats like saying &#8216;the name rhymes with Ill Pinton!&#8217; and no doing impressions or pointing at anything &#8211; just verbal description) &#8211; when one of their teammates successfully calls out the name, they put the piece of paper into their team&#8217;s bowl and pick the next name. After a minute their turn is up and the name in their hand goes back into the big bowl. Teams alternate and who the name-picker is on each team alternates with each turn. When all the names are out, Round 1 is over. Names in each team&#8217;s bowl are tallied up and the score is written down. Then all the names go back into the big bowl. Round 2 is the same as round 1 except the name-picker can only say one word now. No facial expressions or anything. One word and then they have to go blank and hope it&#8217;s enough for their team to get it. Round 3 is like the other 2 rounds except no words now &#8211; just silent acting. Usually that&#8217;s the end but if you wanna get weird, bonus round 4 is the same as round 3 except the name-picker now has a bed sheet over their entire head and body, like a kid in a ghost costume. The team with the highest cumulative score in the 3 (or 4) rounds wins. Only other rule is that if in round 1, the name-picker doesn&#8217;t know the name, they can&#8217;t pass, so they can try to get it using other tricks &#8220;first name is the same name as the first U.S. president, etc.&#8221; or they can challenge. When a player challenges, the timer stops, they say the name, and whoever knows who that person is raises their hand. If fewer than half the other players know the name, the name-picker counts the name as a point and it goes into their team&#8217;s bowl, the timer is started where it left off, and the turn continues. If half or more of the people know the name, the other team gets that name in their bowl and the player&#8217;s turn then continues. Those who don&#8217;t know the name need to learn it then because in future rounds there are no challenges.<a href=\"#note-9-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-9.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-10-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>It&#8217;s always an option to just skip the big catch-up with friends you don&#8217;t see very often, but that&#8217;s not great either because it&#8217;s hard to be close when you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with someone.<a href=\"#note-10-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-10.footnote--><li id=\"footnote-11-9079\" class=\"footnote\"><p>A less risky option if your mammoth is flipping out is to invite the person to a gathering you&#8217;re organizing.<a href=\"#note-11-9079\" class=\"footnote-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-11.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes--><div class=\"footnotes2\"><hr /><ol><li id=\"footnote2-1-9079\" class=\"footnote2\"><p><a class=\"contentLink\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Our World in Data</a><a href=\"#note2-1-9079\" class=\"footnote2-return\">&#8617;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote2-1.footnote--></ol></div><!--/#footnotes2--><p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2021/04/mailbag-2.html\">Mailbag #2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> https://waitbutwhy.com/2021/04/mailbag-2.html/feed 171 9079 The Trump-Biden Debate https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html#comments Tim Urban Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:58:09 +0000 Uncategorized funny politics https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=9026 <p>In case you missed it...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html\">The Trump-Biden Debate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> <p>In case you missed it, here\u2019s a transcript of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cathmZFeXs&amp;ab_channel=NBCNews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first Trump-Biden Debate</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Wallace: </strong>Good evening. I\u2019m Chris Wallace and I welcome you to what I predict will be a very bad personal experience for me. There will be six 15-minute segments, each on a different topic. At the beginning of each segment, both candidates will get two uninterrupted minutes to respond. The remainder of the segment will be open discussion. The audience has agreed not to be trashy. Both campaigns have signed off on these rules, so for sure nothing will go wrong. And with that, let\u2019s welcome the candidates.</p>\n[CANDIDATES ENTER]\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Let\u2019s start with the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation to nominate someone to the court. Vice President Biden, you&#8217;ve called this an abuse of power. To start, why don\u2019t you both explain your positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Amy Coney Barrett is a perfect nominee. Conservatives love her. Liberals love her. Chris Wallace loves her.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Amy Barrett would repeal the Affordable Care Act. And besides, the new thing is that you have to wait until after the election to nominate someone.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Not sure what you&#8217;re talking about, because last I checked a presidential term is four years, not three. You want to instate Communist medicine.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t want to instate Communist medicine. I want to expand Obamacare.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Your party wants to instate Communist medicine, and you\u2019re scared of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I may be scared of them but I <em>am</em> the Democrat Party now, so even if I was and still am scared of them, I\u2019m not anymore. They\u2019ll do what I say now. And how about Covid? The president killed 200,000 people. Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You would have killed 2 million people by not banning China. Not Roe v. Wade.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>K let\u2019s go back to healthcare for a minute. Mr. President, over the past four years you have promised to replace and repeal Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yes I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>with a plan\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Of course I have.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>replace\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I got rid of the individual mandate.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Oba\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate was a joke.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>macare.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate was the worst part of Obamacare.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I am the moder\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The individual mandate sucks dick.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I AM THE MODERATOR of this debate and I would like to be treated as such. You have never come up with a plan to replace Obamacare. So what is the Trump healthcare plan?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I\u2019m cutting drug prices. Insulin is like water.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Uh huh. How about you Joe? Why do you want to end private insurance?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t want to end private insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You\u2019re literally friends with Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>No I\u2019m not. I want to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You\u2019re a piece of shit Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I want to make sure\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>A sad little man.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Stop picking on Joe, Mr. President.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You care deeply about Bernie Sanders. You like Communist medicine. Anyway I asked the doctors and they said Obamacare is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>He doesn\u2019t have a plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Changing gears, Joe some of your colleagues are talking about ending the filibuster and packing the court. What\u2019s your stance on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>My stance is that voting is good. Americans should vote. It\u2019s easy. You just go to the polling place, you wait in line, and then you go into the booth, and you push the little switch down for the candidate you want to vote for. Sometimes it\u2019s not a switch.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>You gonna pack the court, Joe? Tell us about how you\u2019re gonna pack the court, Joe. The radical Left is pulling your puppet strings Joe. You and I both know it Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Shut up, man.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>This is going well. Okay next segment. Covid-19. There have been more than 7 million cases in the United States and more than 200,000 have died. The question is, why should people trust you more than your opponent to handle this public health crisis?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>40,000 people a day contracting Covid. 200,000 people dead. He has no plan. He knew in February. He lied. He panicked. He complimented China. He has no plan. He\u2019s playing golf.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I saved lives. It\u2019s China\u2019s fault. You wanted to let Chinese people come here. Dr. Fauci and all the Democrat governors said, \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job.\u201d And they\u2019re not the only ones. All of the other people said it too. \u201cPresident Trump did a phenomenal job,\u201d they all said. I did a phenomenal job. The gowns, the masks, the ventilators, you don\u2019t know how to make a ventilator, the vaccine is here, any week now. You could never have done the job I did because you\u2019re a random old man. You couldn\u2019t even do swine flu. Swine flu is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong> He panicked. People died. And more people are gonna die unless he gets a lot smarter\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Did you just use the word smart? You lied about going to college at Delaware State. You were the worst student at Delaware State. You\u2019re a dumb fuck Joe. I know it. Chris Wallace knows it don\u2019t you Chris.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Biden:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks. Are you not in favor of masks?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Masks are tremendous. I have a mask right here in my pocket. I wear masks when needed. Masks have said I\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. Joe wears masks even when it makes no sense. He wears them when he\u2019s 200 feet away from me. He wears a mask when he\u2019s sleeping.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. Vice President, is that true?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>If you wanna open a business, you gotta have a plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Sir, I was asking about masks.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Oh masks? Sure, you gotta have a mask.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Alright next segment. The economy. Mr. Trump, you go first.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>It\u2019s a big dick economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>No.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Okay how about taxes. Mr. President, apparently you pay $750 a year in taxes. There\u2019s a girl my daughter knows who\u2019s 15 and she works in a movie theater on Sundays and sells the candy. And she pays more than $750 a year in taxes. So is this true, Mr. President? How much did you pay in taxes in 2016 and 2017?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Miyyons.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Miyyons, sir?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Miyyons and Biyyons. I don\u2019t pay taxes because the Obama administration said I didn\u2019t have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Joe, what\u2019s your plan for taxes?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden:</strong> I\u2019m gonna build this economy. I\u2019m gonna make jobs. We\u2019re gonna buy American. We\u2019re gonna buy American ships. American steel. American buildings. We handed him a booming economy and he blew it.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>But did you actually hand him a booming economy and did he actually blow it?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Sure, whatever. He talks about the art of the deal. China has perfected the art of the steal.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>China buttered your son\u2019s belly.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>China did no such thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>And then, Joe? You know what happened after that? Your son went to Moscow. And you know what happened there Joe? Moscow buttered your son\u2019s belly.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Nothing happened there.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Sure did Joe. The mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife. She buttered his belly slick.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>You wanna talk about families Trump? How about your family. With their grease and their shoes. It\u2019s not about families. It\u2019s about the American people. It\u2019s about families.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Oh and how about Ukraine?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>You know what? Time to move on to\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Ukraine buttered the shit out of\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Ukraine buttered him up real good.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. <em>President</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Shut your mouth Chris. What about Ukraine Joe?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong> VAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH</p>\n<p><strong>Trump:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Now I\u2019m gonna say something and I want you to listen right to me, Mr. President. I have had it up to here with you. Any more misbehaving and I will put you in timeout.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>And you know what else\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I will put you <em>right in timeout</em>, Mr. President. And then you\u2019ll be sorry. Now I want you to stop being a bad boy, is that clear?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>How about him? He should get timeout too.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Well frankly, Mr. President, you\u2019ve been the badder boy.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s been plenty bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>For the next segment, we\u2019ll be talking about race. Why should voters trust you to deal with the race issues facing this country? Mr. Vice President, we\u2019ll start with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I\u2019m all for race. It\u2019s about equity. About equality. About equanimity. Equilibrium. Equinox. We need to fix the systemic equity of racism and fragility in this country. And this president has done none of that. He wants to fix the systemic equity of the Nazis.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>The blacks love me. Everyone knows that the blacks love me. I have blacks come up to me on the street all the time and tell me they love me. Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and I have done more for the blacks than Joe could ever dream of. Joe won\u2019t say law enforcement. Why won\u2019t you say it Joe? Why are you such a puppet Joe? You\u2019re the radical Left\u2019s toy. You\u2019re a yo-yo. The radical Left won\u2019t let you say law enforcement because they bounce you like a yo-yo, Joe.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I want to turn to the subject of protests. In many cities, things have turned violent. Portland, for instance, is a certifiable madhouse. Mr. Biden, have you ever called the mayor of Portland or the governor of Oregon and been like, \u201cwtf?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I don\u2019t have their numbers. Otherwise I would have. Do you have their numbers Chris? If you do, text them to me. And besides, they\u2019re taking care of things just fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Yeah Joe? They\u2019re fine? They\u2019re literally murdering people in the streets, which is a disaster, and no one in Portland cares.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President do you like or not like white supremacists?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No of course not. I don\u2019t not like, or don\u2019t not not like any of the people.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President, what is your message to white supremacists?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Get your guns but don\u2019t fire till I give the word. Anyway the Left is committing 99% of the violence right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Oh baloney. Antifa is an idea, not an organization. I heard it means anti-fascist, in which case heck, sign me up. And anyhow who hasn\u2019t thrown urine at an old lady on a bad day? The Antifas are just like you and me.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>I\u2019m having an awful time here. I\u2019m really upset and I want to leave and I\u2019m having a bad, bad time. For the next segment, let\u2019s just go with \u201cwhy should you be president over your opponent?\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>There has never been a leader who has done more than I\u2019ve done. And I don\u2019t mean just U.S. presidents. Mandela. Attila the Hun. Caesar. King Tut. None of them did as much as I\u2019ve done. I unified this country. For the first time in U.S. history, I ended division. I have the first 100% approval rating. And how about judges. I have 300 judges. I have judges up the ass, Chris. You know why? Because Obama and crazy Uncle Joe forgot to fill the seats. Who does that. No one does that. You forget your keys, sure I\u2019ve forgotten my keys, I\u2019m human, we all forget our keys, sometimes I leave my keys. But leaving judges is a disaster.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>This man has made the country weaker, sicker, poorer, fatter, sloppier, and slipperier. When I was Vice President I went head-to-head with Putin, but Trump is Putin\u2019s little puppy. His cuddle-bunny. His bushy-bushy-boo-boo.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>At least Putin\u2019s not my sugar daddy, like he is to your son.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>K speaking of that, fuck off. Second, you talk about the military being losers\u2014my son was in Iraq and he was no loser, he was a patriot.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>Which son, the loser or the dead one?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wallace:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I don\u2019t know the dead one, but if I recall, the loser got thrown out of the military, dishonorably discharged for having a nice time with his cocaine, only to then head off on his famous belly-buttering tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>His belly is dry!</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Oh for fuck\u2019s sake. Let\u2019s move on to climate change. Mr. President, what do you believe about the science of climate change, and what is your plan to confront it?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I want clean water and air. As far as the California fires are concerned, the forest floors are full of dead trees and leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Okay but what do you believe about the science of climate change?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>I want clean water and air. I\u2019ve planted a biyyon trees. We\u2019ve got to pick the leaves up in the forest in California. Every year I get the call. California\u2019s burning again. Because again they didn\u2019t pick up the fucking leaves. You know in Europe, they pick up leaves.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Joe?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>I want to get rid of fossil fuel plants and invest in renewable energy. I want to transition to electric cars and make green buildings and create millions of new jobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>He\u2019s talking about the Green New Deal. The 55 quadrillion dollar Green New Deal.</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>The Green New Deal is a plan that\u2019ll pay for itself. It\u2019ll work great.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Do you support the Green New Deal?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>Of course not. I\u2019m talking about the Biden Plan. Who said anything about the Green New Deal?</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mercifully, we\u2019ve reached the final segment of my extremely awful night. Election integrity. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>There is no evidence that mail-in ballots are problematic. Trump is trying to convince people not to vote. Listen to me America. Get out there and vote. If I get enough votes, this whole thing is over and the bad man can\u2019t hurt you. It doesn\u2019t matter what he says, if I get enough votes he\u2019s legit not in power anymore, how rad is that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Mr. President?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>A squirrel\u2019s ass, Chris. That\u2019s where someone found a ballot the other day. A squirrel shit out a ballot in a park in Philadelphia and a man picked it up and guess what? It said Trump on the ballot. Big shocker there. This is what happens with mail-in ballots. They end up in a trash can in a river in the woods in the backcountry and then eventually the trash can gets caught up in an eddy, we both know how eddies work Chris, and it washes up on the bank, and then a squirrel gets into it and eats the ballots. Half the country\u2019s ballots have already been found in eddies and in squirrels, and all of them were votes for me. Mail-in ballots are a fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>One thing we all know for sure is that this election is going to be a shitshow. Will you accept the results of the shitshow and tell your supporters to accept the results peacefully?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>If there\u2019s no fraud, yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Is there any foreseeable outcome where you lose and you don\u2019t say it\u2019s fraud?</p>\n<p><strong>Trump: </strong>No. I\u2019ve already talked about the squirrels. If I lose, we\u2019ll need to end the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>Biden?</p>\n<p><strong>Biden: </strong>The country can go on if I lose.</p>\n<p><strong>Wallace: </strong>And that concludes what will end up as a stain on my career even though it clearly wasn\u2019t my fault. Thank you, and goodnight.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our unannoying-I-promise <strong><a class=\"ClickPico PicoRule\" href=\"https://mailchi.mp/waitbutwhy/email-signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email list</a></strong> and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.</p>\n<p>To support Wait But Why, <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>visit our Patreon page</strong></a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>More Places:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/second-presidential-debate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>The Trump-Clinton Town Hall</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/american-presidents-washington-lincoln.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The full deal with the first 16 presidents</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why you should stop caring what other people think</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html\">The Trump-Biden Debate</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/debate2020.html/feed 757 9026 The Big and the Small https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html#comments Tim Urban Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:28:48 +0000 Uncategorized math science https://waitbutwhy.com/?p=8973 <p>I have a surprise for you.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/09/universe.html\">The Big and the Small</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com\">Wait But Why</a>.</p> <p>I have a surprise for you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-surprise.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8992 aligncenter\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-surprise.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"381\" /></a></p>\n<p>I\u2019ll tell you about it in a minute.

I just gave you a tour of my house, where I spend a large portion of my life thinking about the size of things.</p>\n<p>I have visitors in the fun room from time to time, but after a few minutes, they\u2019re usually pretty funned out and leave me to my crises. But one day, something unexpected happened.</p>\n<p>It was 2013. Wait But Why was a few months old. And I got an email from someone named Philipp Dettmer. I was slightly unsettled by the pp and tt, but I decided to read what he had to say.</p>\n<p>He explained that he lives in Germany where he makes animated educational videos about a lot of different things, kind of like Wait But Why but a different medium. I took a look at his YouTube page. It was named a random string of letters:</p>\n<p>kurzgesagt</p>\n<p>Apparently it means \u201cIn a Nutshell\u201d in German, but I didn\u2019t know that at the time and was <em>very </em>close to being done with Philipp Dettmer for good when I decided to watch one of the videos.</p>\n<p>It was <em>delightful</em>.</p>\n<p>I watched another. And another. And then it hit me.</p>\n<p>Philipp\u2014this random man in Germany\u2014<em>also lives in the fun room.</em></p>\n<p>The next day, we were on the phone. There was a lot to talk about. We decided we had to do something together, and we settled on adapting <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/08/putting-time-in-perspective.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of my early posts</a> into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkV6IpV2Y0&amp;ab_channel=Kurzgesagt%E2%80%93InaNutshell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kurzgesagt video</a>.<a href=\"#footnote-1-8973\" id=\"note-1-8973\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a>\n<p>In the seven years since then, Philipp and I have become great friends, and I have not missed a kurzgesagt video since. Whenever Philipp and I get dinner, we head straight to the fun room to talk about the universe. And a few months ago, we decided to collaborate again. It was time to go public with the fun room.</p>\n<p>At some point in our pasts, we had both become enamored with two fun room icons, Cary and Michael Huang, known on the internet as the Huang Twins. The twins do <a href=\"https://www.htwins.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a lot of cool things</a>, but it was their <a href=\"https://www.htwins.net/scale2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scale of the Universe</a> toy that we loved most.</p>\n<p>Inspired by their work, we decided to go for it. We wanted to make the best size explorer we could imagine. We called it Universe in a Nutshell.</p>\n<p>Of course, it took roughly 18 times longer than we thought it would. We brainstormed the interface for quite some time, and then Philipp, along with the incredible kurzgesagt team, dug into working on illustrations and animations, while I worked with the team on the written explainers.</p>\n<p>Thousands of human hours later, the app is done. 250 objects, 30,000+ words of explanations and fun facts, just the right mood music, and what we think is a pretty great interface.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works:</p>\n<p>The app is a giant wall. The wall is impossibly large\u2014large enough to fit full-sized galaxies on it. The wall is also impossibly high-resolution\u2014hi-res enough to contain sharp images of subatomic particles.</p>\n<p>I know it seems weird that I\u2019m talking about it as if it\u2019s a real object, but I have a good reason: to get the full mind-blow effect, you have to realize what you\u2019re looking at. You\u2019re not moving forward and backward through a tunnel of objects\u2014it just seems that way because your brain will refuse to accept the insanity of the actual sizes you\u2019re seeing. By reminding yourself again and again that all of these objects are \u201cpainted\u201d on the same 2D wall, you\u2019ll hopefully experience some fun mind-bending moments.</p>\n<p>The app looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8994 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot.jpeg 2436w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot-600x277.jpeg 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot-750x346.jpeg 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot-768x355.jpeg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot-1536x709.jpeg 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.1-screenshot-2048x946.jpeg 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2436px) 100vw, 2436px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8996\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot.jpeg 2436w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot-600x277.jpeg 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot-750x346.jpeg 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot-768x355.jpeg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot-1536x709.jpeg 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.3-screenshot-2048x946.jpeg 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2436px) 100vw, 2436px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8995 aligncenter\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot.jpeg 2436w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot-600x277.jpeg 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot-750x346.jpeg 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot-768x355.jpeg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot-1536x709.jpeg 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3.2-screenshot-2048x946.jpeg 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2436px) 100vw, 2436px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And there are three ways to zoom:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8997 aligncenter\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2436\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom.png 2436w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom-600x277.png 600w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom-750x346.png 750w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom-768x355.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom-1536x709.png 1536w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-Zoom-2048x946.png 2048w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2436px) 100vw, 2436px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can tap any object for an explainer and fun facts.

It wasn\u2019t a normal glint like from a shiny rock or a piece of metal\u2014it was a little pinprick of flashing light.</p>\n<p>Intrigued, I was now on all fours looking closer. And I saw the most surreal thing.</p>\n<p><em>Tiny houses.</em></p>\n<p>Like <em>tiny </em>houses. Each about a millimeter high, like ornately carved grains of sand.</p>\n<p>I was either dreaming or looking at the coolest, <em>cutest </em>little art project ever.</p>\n<p>As I examined the microscopic village, I noticed what looked like a scrawl of teeny letters on the dirt next to the houses. It said:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PUT YOUR THUMB ON THE OVAL</p>\n<p>Now fully having the time of my life, I looked around for an oval. I searched for a few minutes with no luck until I saw, a bit outside the area where the houses were, a little strip of silver, maybe two millimeters long and a millimeter wide. Careful not to damage the houses, I put my thumb on it.</p>\n<p>I won\u2019t be able to accurately describe what happened next, but I\u2019ll try my best. Imagine if the ground underneath you suddenly felt like a furiously spinning liquid whirlpool, combined with the feeling of freefalling, combined with your entire visual field turning into a blurry gray, combined with the worst nausea of your life.</p>\n<p>And then, just as fast as it started, it all stopped. I cowered for a few seconds trying to catch my breath, and when I opened my eyes, I wasn\u2019t in New York anymore.</p>\n<p>I was on a pastoral ranch, surrounded by big log cabins and a bunch of people staring down at me as I looked up at them, still on all fours. One of the people said to me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel okay, but I\u2019m having <em>severe </em>hallucinations.\u201d</p>\n<p>They all started cheering and hugging and high-fiving each other.</p>\n<p>\u201cAre you doctors?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cHe thinks he has the virus,\u201d one of them said, and they all roared with laughter.</p>\n<p>A woman shushed the crowd and said, \u201cOkay, back to work everyone. I\u2019ll give him the briefing.\u201d</p>\n<p>The others left, and the woman smiled at me. \u201cI\u2019m Layla.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHi Layla. Do I have coronavirus?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re just tiny. We shrunk you to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of your normal size. You haven\u2019t moved anywhere, you\u2019ve just gotten much smaller.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I explained.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, I imagine it\u2019s a lot to take in,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me try to clear things up. There are different tiers of human life, not just the one you\u2019re used to. Our tier is exactly 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> the size of yours. In yours, people are about 180 centimeters tall. Here, we\u2019re about 0.18 millimeters tall. We\u2019d say 180 micrometers tall, but I know in your world, micrometers don\u2019t mean very much.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m 0.18 millimeters tall right now?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout half the size of a dust mite, or a little taller than the width of a human hair up in your world. A person in your world with really good eyesight could <em>barely </em>see you, if they looked closely. And see that house over there?&#8221; She pointed to a large, three-story house. \u201cIn the scale you\u2019re used to, that would be about 10 meters high. Here, it\u2019s about the size of a cubic millimeter\u2014the size of a grain of sand on the sidewalk. Some of our houses were actually carved from grains of sand.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHold on.\u201d I stopped her. \u201cI\u2019m <em>very </em>scared of bugs. I wrote a whole post about it once. Are there <em>giant </em>bugs here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes and no. There are no bugs in our village because we lined the perimeter with a poison that kills any insects that come too close. But you wouldn\u2019t want to walk too far away from the houses\u2014about three centimeters from here, you\u2019ll cross that barrier and run into things you won\u2019t like.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow about flying bugs?\u201d I asked diligently.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t mentioned time yet. Okay so time here moves 100 times faster than it does up on your tier. Time scales up inversely with the square root of the size difference. So 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of the size means 100X faster time. So when a flying insect starts to descend into the village, our defense crew has over a minute here to handle the situation. They fire a jet of air at the insect that deflects it away from us. Same deal for dogs. Every year or two, a dog will pee on us. The defense crew keeps track of every dog walking by. At 1/100<sup>th</sup> the speed of our world, we first see an approaching dog about ten minutes before it gets near us, and by the time a peeing dog is lifting its leg over us, we\u2019ve had plenty of time to draw the tarps, which roll over the entire village and cover everything\u2014the same tarps we use every time it rains or snows.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGood to know. But why am I here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRight, I was about to get to that. After a heated debate in the village, we voted to bring someone from your world here, because we wanted to show you something. We\u2019ve been trying to catch someone\u2019s eye in your world for three of your weeks. That\u2019s almost <em>six years </em>here. That\u2019s why everyone was so excited to see you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you catch my attention?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWith <em>that</em>.\u201d She pointed at a tube on the roof of one of the houses that looked like large telescope. \u201cThat\u2019s a super-powered laser that we\u2019ve been trying to shine in people\u2019s eyes as they walked by on the sidewalk. But no one noticed. Until today. Way out on the horizon, we piled boulders into the shapes of letters that spelled out the instructions, and you were dicking around just hard enough that you actually bent down to read them. We\u2019re thankful.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was that oval in the instructions?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook down.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was standing on a metallic oval about the size of a swimming pool.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is our trans-tier station. When you touched this with your thumb, it shrunk you down to our tier.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait.\u201d I looked up at her. \u201cDo I <em>live</em> here now?\u201d</p>\n<p>She laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll send you back to your world in a little bit. Now come with me.\u201d</p>\n<p>I walked with Layla towards the other side of the village. I looked around. Everyone was staring at me. Some people waved.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked Layla, pointing up at what looked like a sheet of color stretching into the sky.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s your apartment building. All you can see from here is the first brick. That band of light way up in the sky is the mortar between the first and second brick in the wall.\u201d</p>\n<p>We walked into a small building and entered a room with a long white table in the middle. Layla turned towards a wall on the side of the room, and suddenly the outline of a square formed in the wall. The square moved outwards into the room and rotated downwards until it was parallel to the floor. Layla pulled a tweezer-like tool from her pocket and carefully pinched what looked like nothing a few centimeters above the panel.</p>\n<p>She walked over to me. \u201cOpen your palm.\u201d</p>\n<p>She put her tweezers into my hand and dropped something the size of a grain of sand. I raised up my palm to look at it. It was reddish and fuzzy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cSARS-CoV-2. What you&#8217;ve been calling &#8216;coronavirus.&#8217;\u201d</p>\n<p>I flung it across the room. \u201cWhat the <em>fuck</em>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla laughed, touched the square, and the little object flew back across the room into its spot above the square.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt can\u2019t hurt you here. The viruses of your world are <em>way </em>too big to do any damage in our bodies.\u201d</p>\n<p>I stared at her, trying to process the situation. \u201cHow do you know about coronavirus? And how did you\u2026<em>get </em>one?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh we know everything about your world. Your tier moves so slowly compared to ours that your technology is eons behind ours. Our tools have allowed us to watch your world since your prehistoric days. As for how we got a coronavirus particle, we didn\u2019t get it\u2014we <em>made </em>it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>You </em>made the coronavirus?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, with a little help. Follow me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Again I followed Layla, again dumbfounded, this time out of the building toward a fenced-in area outside. When we got close, a door in the fence opened and inside, we stood together on the edge of what looked like a barren circle of land.</p>\n<p>Layla opened her hand. The little virus was sitting neatly on her palm. \u201cSARS-CoV-2 is a standard sized Coronavirus\u2014about 120 nanometers in diameter. 120 nanometers is ridiculously small in your world, but in ours, you can roll it around in your fingers.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool\u2026let me think about that for a minute.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, I can explain this better. In your world, this is a perfect size analogy:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">SARS-CoV-2 : grain of sand :: grain of sand : house</p>\n<p>In both cases, the relationship is 1-to-10,000, which is also the relationship of our world to yours. In your world, your apartment building is huge, a grain of sand is tiny, and this coronavirus is unfathomably microscopic. In ours, the virus is tiny, a grain of your sand is huge enough to live in, and your apartment building is unfathomably large.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNow, what\u2019s a virus made of? Atoms. And atoms are about 0.1 nanometers in diameter\u2014about 1/1,000<sup>th</sup> of the diameter of a SARS-CoV-2 particle. That\u2019s small even for <em>us.</em> An atom is almost as small for us as a virus is for you. Constructing a virus requires incredibly complex engineering and tools that can interact with the quantum field. We can\u2019t do it ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo how\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cLook down.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked at the ground.</p>\n<p>She pulled me toward the center of the circle of land and then pulled me to an abrupt stop.</p>\n<p>\u201cLook closer.\u201d</p>\n<p>I bent over as far as I could and strained my eyes. No. Fucking. Way.</p>\n<p><em>Another microscopic world</em>.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cIs that</em>\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s the tier below <em>us</em>. Give me your thumb.\u201d</p>\n<p>She carefully placed the virus particle onto the ground. Then she guided my hand to the ground, touching both of our thumbs to a little metallic spot.</p>\n<p>Whirlpool. Falling. Gray. Nausea. Misery.</p>\n<p>I eventually got a hold of my trembling and drooling and opened my eyes. In every direction, as far as I could see, stretched a hazy blue-ish / purple-ish plane. It also began to dawn on me that I wasn\u2019t standing or sitting on anything\u2014I was <em>floating</em>.</p>\n<p>After about a minute of wondering what the <em>hell </em>was going on in my life, a patch of the sky darkened. The dark region became smaller and more defined until it condensed into Layla floating next to me.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again,\u201d I said.</p>\n<p>\u201cSorry, my thumb hit the pad a split second later than yours did. Time moves 100 times faster here than up there, so you got to spend some reflective time here by yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOkay where are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re outside your apartment building. Remember?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRighttt. So what <em>size</em> are we?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe went down the same jump you did when you transitioned from your world to ours\u2014we shrunk to 1/10,000<sup>th</sup> of our previous size. So you\u2019re now 18 nanometers tall. If you stood on the edge of a cross-section of a human hair, it would take you about two hours to walk across it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTime here is now going by at 100X the speed of time in my world, which means it\u2019s moving 10,000 times faster than the speed of time in yours. You could spend a year here and less than an hour would pass in your world.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cKind of like Inception?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really. Anyway, nothing down here works the way it does in our worlds. Like see how the ground is all eternal and purply?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really ground, and it\u2019s not really purple. When you\u2019re this small, there aren\u2019t any solid objects in the sense you understand. And your eyes are too small now to perceive the visible light spectrum.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo what the hell?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t really get it either. But the people who live here have incredibly advanced ways of manipulating the quantum field so we can feel like we\u2019re intact humans, floating in place, seeing purple. They set it up this way because it\u2019s something we can make sense of.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of them. Where are they all anyway?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe thing is, they don\u2019t like our world, and they <em>really </em>don\u2019t like your world. They interact with us occasionally, when it\u2019s necessary, but they\u2019ll never allow you or anyone from your world to see them or know anything about how they live. This is actually the first time anyone from your world has been allowed down here, other than Andy Kaufman, who\u2019s lived here since 1984.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen why am I allowed to be here?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I can show you this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla straightened her arm in front of her, with her palm facing outwards. Her palm lit up and when it did, a bizarre-looking giant object was revealed in front of us.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis,\u201d Layla said, \u201cis SARS-CoV-2. Down here, it\u2019s the size of a house.\u201d</p>\n<p>I looked up at the vast virus in front of me. It looked nothing like it had when it was a fuzzy grain of sand in my hand. It was transparent, like a massive, intricately structured, sphere-shaped jellyfish. There was a kind of furious movement within the transparency, but I couldn\u2019t see anything specific moving. It was confusing.</p>\n<p>Layla motioned for me to come close to the virus. She took my hand and placed my palm onto the virus\u2019s almost invisible surface. It felt kind of like palming a grape bunch except instead of grapes it was tapioca balls like the ones in those bubble teas\u2014if the tapioca balls were vibrating so vigorously that it felt a little like being mildly electroshocked, like when you put your finger in an electrical outlet. It was an unpleasant sensation, though not quite painful, and <em>super </em>weird and cool-feeling.</p>\n<p>\u201cPull one off,\u201d Layla said.</p>\n<p>It took me a few tries to latch onto one of the atoms, because they\u2019re \u201cslippery\u201d (quotes because there is no word for what it felt like, but &#8220;slippery&#8221; gets the general idea across), and when I finally got one and pulled, there was a lot of resistance. When I pulled it, it dragged the adjacent atoms along with it, and the harder I pulled, the more ferociously and unpleasantly it vibrated. Finally it <em>snapped </em>free. I looked at my fist\u2014<em>I had an atom.</em></p>\n<p>Layla smiled. \u201cCool right?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201c<em>So </em>cool. Can I keep it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSure good luck with that.\u201d</p>\n<p>I was so awe-struck by so many things, I had forgotten how intensely confused I was.</p>\n<p>\u201cWait, so why did you <em>make</em> this?\u201d</p>\n<p>She turned towards me. \u201cAs I said, because of the way time moves\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYour world has been around a lot longer than ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes. And <em>this</em> world we\u2019re in now has been around a lot longer than <em>mine</em>. They know much more about everything than we do, and they can do things we can\u2019t even begin to understand. The stuff they can do is so over our heads they can\u2019t even <em>explain </em>it to us. And <em>we\u2019re</em> that far ahead of <em>your</em> world.</p>\n<p>For a long time, as advanced as this world was, it relied on us to preserve our world for its own survival. It exists on a patch of dirt in our village. If our village were destroyed, they would be destroyed with it. But a while back, they worked out the technology for how to be <em>location independent</em>, which means they can move from wherever they are to any other place in the universe instantly.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t have that technology yet. We tried to learn from them, but we couldn\u2019t grasp the fundamental ideas well enough to develop it ourselves. So we\u2019re stuck in our location.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIn New York City?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYup. We migrated here in the 1800s when we determined it would be a good place to interface with your world, should the need ever arise. We\u2019re also not the only people in our world. There are lots of villages like ours in different parts of the Earth. Once we connected with you, the others stopped broadcasting their location. There\u2019s no reason for more than one of us to be revealed to your world.</p>\n<p>For most of time, Earth was a safe and stable home for our world. But over the last century, your world has been advancing exponentially in technology but remaining stagnant in wisdom. You\u2019re rapidly gaining tremendous powers but still behaving like short-sighted primates. The voice of wisdom is there, but it\u2019s being trampled over by political parties, religions, and nations too mired in blind conflict to lift their heads up and see the bigger picture.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you say that Layla. I\u2019m actually writing a whole thing about\u2014\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh I know. We did our research on everyone who lives in your vicinity so we\u2019d know how to communicate with the person we brought to us if we caught someone\u2019s attention. That\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking English and speaking in the odd way you do. Your little series is cute, even if it took us forever to read\u2014but it will have limited effect. Your world is stubborn about growing up. And in the process of destroying yourselves, we believe you\u2019ll destroy us as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to kill us off with a pandemic.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf we wanted to kill you off, you\u2019d all be dead right now. It\u2019s an option we hope we don\u2019t have to use. We were once like you and we empathize with your struggle.</p>\n<p>We created this coronavirus to fall into a certain sweet spot\u2014not damaging enough to destroy your world, but bad enough to cause a long and scary global crisis. Short of an alien attack, it is the one thing that could make all humans in your world feel like they\u2019re on the same team against a common enemy. The first and most crucial step on the road to a long-lasting species is the epiphany that you truly are a single team, alone in a dark and dangerous universe. We\u2019re hoping the virus can help push you in that direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI feel like there was a better way to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe probably could have thought a little harder about it.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah cause it\u2019s going pretty badly up there is the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTotes. Anyway, we couldn\u2019t make the virus on our own. It\u2019s hard enough to make something that small and complex that involves atomic and subatomic construction, but we wanted the virus to be <em>precisely</em> as harmful as it is. We needed help. The tier below us is less vulnerable to your world than we are, but for reasons I\u2019m not entirely sure about, they also believe living in a multi-tiered ecosystem may be important in the future\u2014so they share our interests. They agreed to build the virus for us.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow did you manage to get the virus into our world?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny. You have to imagine it from our perspective. If you\u2019re us, the world you\u2019re planning to transform is a planet with nearly an <em>AU</em> diameter, full of <em>18-kilometer tall people</em>\u2014people so tall, your world\u2019s airplanes could accidentally fly into their belly buttons. Now imagine you\u2019re standing on that planet, smaller than one of their dust mites, pinching between your fingers something the size of a grain of sand <em>on your scale</em>. You find your way onto one of these giants\u2019 football-field-size teeth, and you <em>flick </em>the grain of sand into his kilometer-wide chasm of a mouth. And <em>that\u2019s</em> supposed to change the trajectory of their future. It seems impossible.</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd yet. With some very clever maneuvers, we flicked our little particle into the mouth of an unlucky giant, and it did the trick. By the way, we were dying when you blamed it on a <em>pangolin </em>of all things.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHe seemed guilty. I still don\u2019t understand why you brought <em>me</em> down here.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t originally planning to reveal any of this backstory to your world. But after watching things unfold for the first few weeks, we don\u2019t see enough of the effect we were hoping for. Maybe if your world learns that there are other worlds out there\u2014worlds that did manage to triumph in the wisdom game\u2014it\u2019ll empower the wise voices to stand up with a bit more courage in this struggle and in even greater challenges that lie ahead. It\u2019s a long shot, but these are desperate times.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s worth a try. I\u2019ll write a post explaining what I learned from you.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cAnd tweet out the post and send it out to your email list and stuff?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cEh. Fine.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReady to go back up to your life? Only 23 seconds have passed there since you shrunk down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Layla and I moved ourselves on top of the big metal oval.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m going to increase my size 10,000-fold and yours 100,000,000-fold, so you can go back home in one shot\u2026which is a good thing because transporting up is even worse than transporting down.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI have one more question.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHow many tiers are there?\u201d I asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo one knows for sure.

Quick note before we jump in:</p>\n<p>This is a post about something I\u2019ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are\u2014which is weird because I\u2019m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it\u2019s super clear he has very little idea what he\u2019s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.</p>\n<p>This post isn\u2019t me giving you career advice really\u2014it\u2019s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You\u2019re not a pro at this, but you\u2019re certainly more qualified to figure out what\u2019s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren\u2019t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren\u2019t sure you&#8217;re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.</p>\n<p>Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It\u2019s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why\u2014a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I\u2019m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here.

One is that at that moment, you\u2019re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6733\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg 1500w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-281x300.jpg 281w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-768x819.jpg 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2-563x600.jpg 563w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p>\n<p>But before you can even address your general uselessness, there&#8217;s an even bigger issue\u2014your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path\u2014except you. And you&#8217;ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you&#8217;ve only been in charge of the micro decisions\u2014&#8221;How do I succeed at my job as a student?&#8221;\u2014and now you&#8217;re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; and &#8220;What are the important things in life?&#8221; and &#8220;What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?&#8221; When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we&#8217;ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.</p>\n<p>Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life\u2019s story.</p>\n<p>At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life\u2019s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.</p>\n<p>When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren&#8217;t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don&#8217;t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn&#8217;t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.</p>\n<p>So this is a post about path-making. Let\u2019s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we\u2019re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Cook and the Chef\u2014Revisited</strong></span></p>\n<p>In the past, <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I\u2019ve written about</a> the critical distinction between \u201creasoning from first principles\u201d and \u201creasoning by analogy\u201d\u2014or what I called being a \u201cchef\u201d vs. being a \u201ccook.\u201d Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I\u2019ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.</p>\n<p>The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning\u2014reasoning by analogy\u2014happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there\u2014kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.</p>\n<p>A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.</p>\n<p>Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy\u2014which makes sense, because you\u2019re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you\u2019re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I\u2019m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I\u2019m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I\u2019ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense\u2014because clothes aren\u2019t important to me, and they\u2019re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.<a href=\"#footnote-2-6721\" id=\"note-2-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a>\n<p>But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important\u2014like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.</p>\n<p>Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let\u2019s spell out the obvious reasons why:</p>\n<p><strong>Time. </strong>For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you\u2019ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you\u2019re left with 250,000 \u201cmeaningful adult hours.\u201d<a href=\"#footnote-3-6721\" id=\"note-3-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a> So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time\u2014not something to be a cook about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6735\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"713\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png 900w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-253x300.png 253w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-768x912.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart-505x600.png 505w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Quality of Life. </strong>Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you\u2019re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.</p>\n<p><strong>Impact. </strong>On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can\u2019t test this, but I\u2019m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future\u2014but the <em>kind</em> of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.</p>\n<p><strong>Identity. </strong>In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to <em>be</em> when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we <em>are. </em>We don\u2019t say, \u201cI practice law\u201d\u2014we say, \u201cI am a lawyer.\u201d This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person\u2019s career quadruples as the person\u2019s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.</p>\n<p>So yeah\u2014your career path isn\u2019t like my shitty sweatshirt. It\u2019s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in \u201cDefinitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it\u201d territory.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Your Career Map</strong></span></p>\n<p>Which brings us to you.

One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, \u201cAm I qualified to write about this?\u201d Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:</p>\n<p>1) I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.</p>\n<p>2) My path has taken a lot of turns\u2014from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.</p>\n<p>3) After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That\u2019s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.</p>\n<p>4) On top of having my own story to look at, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I\u2019ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.</p>\n<p>5) Finally, this isn\u2019t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful\u2014there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I\u2019m not one of them. It\u2019s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We\u2019ll come back to it at the end of the post. It\u2019s time now for a deep dive\u2014let\u2019s think about this from scratch. From first principles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cook-chef post</a>, I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices.

But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let\u2019s start with the Want Box.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box</strong></span></p>\n<p>The hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things\u2014or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants\u2014and fears\u2014its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it\u2019ll specifically mean going directly <em>against</em> others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Yearning Octopus</strong></span></p>\n<p>To do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it.

It\u2019s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It\u2019s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don\u2019t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach\u2014it\u2019s a highly needy tentacle.</p>\n<p>And yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it\u2019s the ickiest set of yearnings to really <em>go</em> for; because the fears of this tentacle aren\u2019t scary in an immediate way\u2014they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person\u2014who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6749\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png 1218w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-300x275.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-768x704.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle-600x550.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.</p>\n<p>As we\u2019ve discussed <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">before</a> on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who\u2019s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn\u2019t want to be in the outgroup. He\u2019s <a href=\"https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quite cute</a> though.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s your ego, who\u2019s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn\u2019t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon\u2014ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.</p>\n<p>There are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren\u2019t judging you fairly\u2014if you\u2019re not appropriately appreciated. It\u2019s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges\u2014which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to <em>show</em> that person or those people who never believed in them.</p>\n<p>Finally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you\u2019re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It\u2019s probably a parent.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6750\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png 1079w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-287x300.png 287w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-768x802.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle-574x600.png 574w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day\u2014with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible\u2014as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.</p>\n<p>The issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it\u2019s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn\u2019t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6846\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"847\" height=\"726\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png 1400w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-300x257.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-768x658.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1-600x514.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks\u2014each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth\u2014a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to <em>deploy</em>.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can\u2019t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy\u2019s sake\u2014they think, \u201cOther people aren\u2019t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?\u201d\u2014but they <em>can </em>understand philanthropy for their own motive&#8217;s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground\u2014the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it\u2019ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people\u2019s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, when you do something philanthropic\u2014or anything altruistic, really\u2014there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you <em>determined </em>to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks \u201cGod I\u2019m a good person\u201d lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, <em>not </em>doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles\u2014the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6752\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png 1214w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-300x262.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-768x672.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle-600x525.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Your Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great\u2014but it would also like to point out that it\u2019s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it\u2019s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they\u2019d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn\u2019t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can\u2019t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll &amp; Hyde sophomore year of college.</p>\n<p>At its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn\u2019t really care how these things happen\u2014it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle\u2019s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don\u2019t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren\u2019t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because \u201cit\u2019s not a good look,\u201d with your personal tentacle chiming in that \u201cyeah, we\u2019re better than that.\u201d</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the situation. You\u2019ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren\u2019t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a <em>single</em> yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s most passionate about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6753\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png 999w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-300x289.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-768x741.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument-600x579.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.</p>\n<p>Or when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity\u2019s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community\u2014while the part of you that can\u2019t stand the thought of the millions of today\u2019s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.</p>\n<p>So yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus\u2014that\u2019s why you\u2019ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Dissecting the Octopus</strong></span></p>\n<p>With that in mind, let\u2019s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus\u2014which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind\u2019s subconscious can we see what\u2019s really going on.<a href=\"#footnote-6-6721\" id=\"note-6-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a>\n<p>The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It\u2019s not off-limits to us\u2014it\u2019s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime\u2014we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.</p>\n<p>So let\u2019s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.</p>\n<p>Like if there\u2019s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career\u2014and which specific parts of those tentacles?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid of failing, unpack <em>that</em>. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that\u2019s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image\u2014of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn\u2019t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle\u2014in other words, is it possible you&#8217;re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the <em>message</em> a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you\u2019ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?</p>\n<p>Perhaps you don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fear of failure that\u2019s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it\u2019s a dread of the change in identity\u2014both internally and externally\u2014that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it\u2019s the heavy weight of inertia\u2014an intense resistance to change\u2014that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you\u2019d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.</p>\n<p>Maybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.</p>\n<p>As you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it\u2019s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning\u2014instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.</p>\n<p>The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You\u2019ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Searching for Imposters</strong></span></p>\n<p>We\u2019re making good progress\u2014but we\u2019re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work\u2014work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don\u2019t materialize out of nowhere. They\u2019re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they\u2019re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they\u2019re the product of either you the chef or you the cook.</p>\n<p>So the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it\u2019s authentically you, or if it\u2019s someone else <em>disguised </em>as you.</p>\n<p>You can pull on a yearning\u2019s face by playing the Why Game. You\u2019ll ask your initial Why\u2014<em>Why is this something I want?\u2014</em>and get to some kind of Because. Then you\u2019ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You\u2019ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you\u2019ll usually discover one of three things:</p>\n<p>1) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You\u2019ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real.</p>\n<p>2) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you\u2014<em>I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me\u2014</em>and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it\u2019s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning\u2019s original installer underneath.</p>\n<p>3) You\u2019ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of \u201cI guess I just know this because it\u2019s true!\u201d This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can\u2019t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you\u2019ll have a hunch about which it is.</p>\n<p>In a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It\u2019s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value.</p>\n<p>In a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you\u2019ve discovered that you\u2019ve been duped. You\u2019ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren\u2019t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you\u2019re a cook following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else\u2019s brain.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a chance you\u2019re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you\u2019re like me and most of my friends\u2014your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you\u2019ll find your mom.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6754\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png 549w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1-296x300.png 296w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6755\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"287\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png 316w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2-215x300.png 215w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6756\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"338\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png 393w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3-254x300.png 254w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6757\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"341\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png 496w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4-228x300.png 228w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4-455x600.png 455w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6819\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"479\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png 725w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1-278x300.png 278w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1-557x600.png 557w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You\u2019ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what\u2019s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6759\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"343\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png 568w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6-229x300.png 229w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6-457x600.png 457w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes you\u2019ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated.</p>\n<p>You might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you\u2026when you were seven years old.

But it\u2019s time well spent\u2014because you\u2019re not your 7-year-old self, just like you\u2019re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You\u2019re Current-Age You\u2014the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don\u2019t want.</p>\n<p>To be clear, this isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by <em>definition </em>influence-able\u2014influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this:</p>\n<p>Do you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you\u2019ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, <em>masquerading as </em>inner you?</p>\n<p>Do you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right\u201d\u2014and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?</p>\n<p>The former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you\u2019re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.</p>\n<p>The good news is that all humans make this mistake\u2014and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it\u2014it\u2019s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It\u2019s your head\u2014you\u2019re allowed to do with it what you want.</p>\n<p>So it\u2019s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go.

Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with.</p>\n<p>But then there are the parts of you that weren\u2019t living on your octopus where they\u2019re supposed to be\u2014instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they\u2019ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it\u2019s almost not there at all. Almost.</p>\n<p>Some parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they\u2019re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution\u2014i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone <em>else</em> locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn\u2019t really you and isn\u2019t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.</p>\n<p>So let\u2019s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6821 \" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"566\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png 990w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-300x265.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-768x679.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1-600x530.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></a></p>\n<p>You may pass some unpleasant characters.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6764\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png 551w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2-236x300.png 236w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2-472x600.png 472w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Leave them for another time\u2014right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you\u2019ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.</p>\n<p>There will be certain parts of your authentic self you won\u2019t be able to uncover in Denial Prison\u2014it\u2019s pretty dark down there. But be patient\u2014now that you\u2019ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Priority Rankings</strong></span></p>\n<p>The other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they\u2019re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it\u2019s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you\u2019re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else\u2014some source of fear or inertia in you\u2014is currently being prioritized above it.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you\u2019ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don\u2019t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it&#8217;s because you\u2019re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running <em>away </em>from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don\u2019t believe you actually care that much about, you\u2019re probably not looking closely enough at your fears.</p>\n<p>With both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: \u201cWho made this order? Was it really me?\u201d</p>\n<p>For example, we\u2019re often told to \u201cfollow our passion\u201d\u2014this is society saying \u201cput your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.\u201d That\u2019s a very specific instruction. Maybe that\u2019s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It\u2019s something you need to independently evaluate.</p>\n<p>To get this right, let\u2019s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we\u2019ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable\u2014if it were, you\u2019d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is <em>you</em>\u2014the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you\u2019ll try to tap into all the wisdom you\u2019ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values\u2014about what you really believe is <em>important</em>. On the other side, it\u2019s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you\u2019ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you\u2019re not super proud of\u2014whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what\u2019s important and what\u2019s you. It\u2019s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it\u2019s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well\u2014depending on where you decide to draw the line. There\u2019s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely.</p>\n<p>To get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you\u2014I like the idea of a shelf:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6817\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png 943w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-300x218.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-768x557.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2-600x435.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings <i>so </i>important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they\u2019ll happen\u2014at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history\u2019s legends were famously single-minded\u2014they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly\u2014if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or <i>maybe </i>two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all.<span class=\"m_1544476509806979791gmail-Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p>Your group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices\u2014but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that\u2019s why it\u2019s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You\u2019re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you\u2019re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they\u2019re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they&#8217;ll often demand it\u2014core parts of you won\u2019t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they\u2019re neglected.</p>\n<p>Most of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, \u201cI know you want these things, but for now, I\u2019ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I\u2019ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you\u2019ll get a shelf upgrade then.\u201d The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the <em>top</em> shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject\u2014those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people\u2019s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.</p>\n<p>As you go through this difficult prioritizing process\u2014inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings\u2014remember that you\u2019re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can\u2019t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment\u2014motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won\u2019t be the wise adult in the room\u2014that\u2019s your job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6789\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"477\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png 1487w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-300x238.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-768x610.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1-600x477.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Finally, as we\u2019ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It\u2019s the opposite\u2014it\u2019s a rough draft written in light pencil. It\u2019s a hypothesis that you\u2019ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice.</p>\n<p>Your Want Box is ready to go. Now let\u2019s turn to your Reality Box.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Deep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box</strong></span></p>\n<p>The Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what\u2019s <em>possible</em>.</p>\n<p>But when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it\u2019s not necessarily based on what you actually want\u2014it\u2019s based on what you <em>think </em>you want\u2014what you\u2019re in the <em>habit </em>of wanting.</p>\n<p>The Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn\u2019t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be\u2014your <em>perception </em>of reality.</p>\n<p>The goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what\u2019s possible to come close to mirroring what\u2019s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings\u2014your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of <em>beliefs</em>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to your career possibilities, you\u2019re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area.</p>\n<p>Us being us, we\u2019re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this:</p>\n<p>There are traditional careers\u2014stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.\u2014and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you\u2019re decently smart and work hard, you\u2019ll end up in a successful, stable situation.</p>\n<p>Then there are less traditional careers\u2014the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.\u2014and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it\u2019s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two.</p>\n<p>These are perfectly reasonable assumptions\u2014if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did\u2014and I suspect that behind most of them, you\u2019ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach\u2014but if you keep going and pull on <em>their </em>face, you\u2019ll usually see that it\u2019s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic<a href=\"#footnote-7-6721\" id=\"note-7-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a>\u2014none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we&#8217;re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth.</p>\n<p>These problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers\u2014and you also conflate talent and skill level\u2014it won\u2019t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we\u2019re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, \u201cI can get there one day\u2014just need to do about 20 years of hard work.&#8221; But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they\u2019re more likely to think, \u201cWow look how talented they are\u2014I\u2019m nowhere near that good,\u201d and get all hopeless. There\u2019s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some \u201cbig break\u201d at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot\u2014and I don\u2019t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards.</p>\n<p>These are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let\u2019s brainstorm how it might actually work:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Career Landscape</strong></span></p>\n<p>I have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly.</p>\n<p>But that\u2019s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet.</p>\n<p>First, there\u2019s the broad landscape\u2014the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today\u2019s society. My current job description is: \u201cWriter of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.\u201d Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options\u2014some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology\u2014and the way things work today, if there\u2019s an option you want that\u2019s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting.</p>\n<p>Then, there\u2019s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today\u2019s available game boards\u2014and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career\u2019s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it\u2019s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.</p>\n<p>This is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, <em>and </em>it\u2019s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide.

The star isn\u2019t about a particular skill level\u2014e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy\u2014it\u2019s about the entire <em>game</em>. In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward\u2014if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you\u2019ve probably hit your star and you\u2019ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the \u201cI want to be a famous actor\u201d star doesn\u2019t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor <em>game </em>as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle\u2014you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that <em>whole </em>game\u2014every component of it\u2014your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. <em>That\u2019s </em>what hitting the star means.</p>\n<p>But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t get how non-traditional careers work\u2014it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it \u201cluck.\u201d To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot.</p>\n<p>So how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It\u2019s all about a simple formula:</p>\n<p>Distance = Speed x Time.</p>\n<p>In our case, the more apt wording might be:</p>\n<p>Progress = Pace x Persistence.</p>\n<p>Your outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you\u2019ll be able to improve at playing that career&#8217;s \u201cgame\u201d and B) the amount of time you\u2019re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let\u2019s talk about both of these:</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Pace</strong></span></p>\n<p>What makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I\u2019d say it comes down to three factors:</p>\n<p><strong>Your level of chefness. </strong>As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they\u2019ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at\u2014then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop\u2026</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6796\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png 1639w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-300x268.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-768x687.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1-600x537.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></a></p>\n<p>\u2026while cooks improve at a snail\u2019s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What\u2019s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef\u2019s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook\u2019s recipe just grows more and more outdated\u2014a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I\u2019m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Your work ethic. </strong>This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who\u2019s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus.</p>\n<p><strong>Your natural abilities. </strong>Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don\u2019t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people\u2014and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types.</p>\n<p>Other things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they\u2019re not components of pace\u2014they\u2019re part of the location of point A.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Persistence</strong></span></p>\n<p>When I say persistence, I&#8217;m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you\u2019re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you\u2019ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours.</p>\n<p>And this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they\u2019re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they\u2019ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn\u2019t matter how awesome you are\u2014if you&#8217;ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you\u2019re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Your Real Strengths and W</strong><strong>eaknesses</strong></span></p>\n<p>With our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let\u2019s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not that &#8220;strengths and weaknesses&#8221; is a bad concept\u2014it\u2019s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness<a href=\"#footnote-8-6721\" id=\"note-8-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a> or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, these items shouldn\u2019t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your <em>potential for improvement</em> in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he\u2019d suck. But calling basketball a \u201cweakness\u201d of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you\u2019d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills\u2014but most general pace and persistence qualities can <em>also</em> be worked on and improved if you focus on them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Filling in the Reality Box</strong></span></p>\n<p>Your true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you\u2019d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it\u2019s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box\u2014just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset.<a href=\"#footnote-9-6721\" id=\"note-9-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a>\n<p>So to be a bit more efficient, let\u2019s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate:</p>\n<p><strong>1) The general landscape. </strong>Take our best crack at evaluating the world\u2019s current career landscape\u2014the full range of options available (or create-able).</p>\n<p><strong>2) Specific game boards.</strong> For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career&#8217;s current game board\u2014the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Starting point.</strong> For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Success point.</strong> Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what\u2019s the minimum level of success you\u2019d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Your pace.</strong> Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to <em>accelerate</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>6) Your level of persistence.</strong> Evaluate the amount of time you think you\u2019ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path\u2019s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it&#8217;s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it&#8217;s good to at least know the equation you&#8217;re working with.</p>\n<p>A from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.</p>\n<p>A good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn\u2019t considered wanting because you hadn\u2019t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive.

You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a tough choice\u2014but it should be <em>way less tough </em>than it is. Here\u2019s why:</p>\n<p>Careers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6787\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png 1100w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-300x232.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-768x593.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2-600x464.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out <em>kind </em>of like tunnels.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s careers\u2014especially the less traditional ones\u2014are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder.</p>\n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn\u2019t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they\u2019ll want to be decades from now\u2014which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster.</p>\n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing.</p>\n<p>When you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they\u2019re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh.</p>\n<p>But conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake\u2014on top of helping us yearn for things we don\u2019t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren\u2019t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren\u2019t accurate\u2014conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>Today\u2019s career landscape isn&#8217;t a lineup of tunnels, it\u2019s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today\u2019s people aren\u2019t synonymous with what they do\u2014they\u2019re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today\u2019s career isn\u2019t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label\u2014it\u2019s a long series of science experiments.</p>\n<p>Steve Jobs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compared</a> life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it\u2019s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it\u2019s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards.</p>\n<p>If you look at the biographies of your heroes, you\u2019ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you\u2019ll probably see the same trend\u2014according to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170420130623/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm\">data</a>, the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer\u201410.4 years on average).</p>\n<p>So seeing your career as a series of dots isn\u2019t a mental trick to help you make decisions\u2014it\u2019s an accurate depiction of what\u2019s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn\u2019t just unproductive\u2014it\u2019s delusional.</p>\n<p>Likewise, you&#8217;re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path\u2014because it\u2019s the only dot you <em>can </em>figure out. You don\u2019t have to worry about dot #4 because you can\u2019t anyway\u2014you\u2019re literally not qualified to do so.</p>\n<p>By the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don\u2019t know now. You\u2019ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You\u2019ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you\u2019re interested in, and you\u2019ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape\u2014and those game boards\u2014will have themselves evolved.</p>\n<p>The fantastic website <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80,000 Hours</a> (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/we-change-more-than-we-expect-so-keep-your-options-open/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you\u2019ll change</a>, that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/which-careers-will-be-automated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the world will change</a>, and that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you\u2019ll only learn with time what you\u2019re actually good at</a>. Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">describes</a> just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future.</p>\n<p>Pretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let\u2019s focus on dot #1.</p>\n<p>If we\u2019re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out.</p>\n<p>Hypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you\u2019d tell her, \u201cYou can\u2019t figure this out on your couch\u2014you\u2019ve gotta start going on dates, and that\u2019ll teach you what you want in a partner.\u201d If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you\u2019d again have to correct her. You\u2019d say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.\u201d</p>\n<p>We can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let\u2019s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation\u2014it\u2019s just a first date.</p>\n<p>This is awesome news\u2014because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it\u2019s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today\u2019s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday\u2019s world. That\u2019s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Making Your Move</strong></span></p>\n<p>You\u2019ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You\u2019ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re super bad at this. We\u2019re frightened people. We don\u2019t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there\u2019s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here\u2019s where it\u2019ll show itself.</p>\n<p>The Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you\u2019ve decided on a life step and you can\u2019t quite take it, it\u2019s because the parts of you that don\u2019t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You\u2019re a CEO not in control of their staff.</p>\n<p>To fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do?</p>\n<p>Go talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They\u2019re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you\u2019ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You\u2019re the teacher\u2014figure it out.</p>\n<p>The older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life\u2019s struggle. The world is easy\u2014<em>you\u2019re </em>difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you\u2019ve uncovered your new #1 priority\u2014becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.</p>\n<p>If your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you\u2019re able to make the jump.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>After the Move</strong></span></p>\n<p>Jumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc.</p>\n<p>First of all, for a while at least, you\u2019ll probably suck at what you\u2019re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that\u2019s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they\u2019ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won\u2019t be feeling much gratification yet, and they\u2019ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn\u2019t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won\u2019t be much fun.</p>\n<p>Even if things do go well, you\u2019ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you\u2019ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down\u2014the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You\u2019ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6788\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"631\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png 1200w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-300x237.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-768x605.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2-600x473.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you get wiser, you\u2019ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You\u2019ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it\u2019s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be.</p>\n<p>The whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions\u2014like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer\u2019s outing\u2014they\u2019re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them\u2014but they\u2019re not the new normal, and they never will be.</p>\n<p>A better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you\u2019re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you\u2019re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.</p>\n<p>People talk about being present in the moment, but there\u2019s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you\u2019re on a career dot that, when you\u2019re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You\u2019ll come back to the big picture later\u2014for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just <em>live</em>.</p>\n<p>These moments don\u2019t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you\u2019ve got into the dot you\u2019ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>The Next Dot?</strong></span></p>\n<p>At some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you\u2019ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the macro mission won\u2019t be the problem. It\u2019ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn\u2019t a release of persistence but the <em>stuff </em>of persistence. This is the <em>mission-enhancing</em> type of dot jump.</p>\n<p>Other times, you\u2019ll feel a darker kind of restlessness\u2014the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you\u2019ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A <em>mission-changing </em>dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move.</p>\n<p>In these moments, it\u2019s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6775\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png 900w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-300x99.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-768x253.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum-600x198.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy\u2014the wing-footed\u2014and they have the opposite pitfall: they\u2019re quick quitters.<a href=\"#footnote-11-6721\" id=\"note-11-6721\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a> (You should be especially wary of cement feet\u2014psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is <a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/12/top-career-regrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201cI wish I had quit earlier,\u201d</a> and the most common advice of the elderly is, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/04/most-important-life-lesson/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Don\u2019t stay in a job you dislike.</a>&#8220;)</p>\n<p>This is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what\u2019s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving\u2014some blue or yellow <em>loop </em>activity:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6804\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png 2500w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-300x263.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-768x674.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small-600x527.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6805\" src=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png 2500w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-300x263.png 300w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-768x674.png 768w , https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small-600x527.png 600w \" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank \u201cgetting wise about dot-jumping\u201d pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape.</p>\n<p>Looking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I\u2019ll be to repeat them in the future.</p>\n<p>Remembering that you\u2019re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn\u2019t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy\u2014but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It\u2019s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It\u2019s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">___________</p>\n<p>Over the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I\u2019ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there\u2019s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren\u2019t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live\u2014the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.</p>\n<p>My own psyche seems to back this up\u2014looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self\u2014the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn&#8217;t to avoid mistakes, it&#8217;s for the mistakes I do make to be my own.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that\u2019s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you\u2014you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">_______</p>\n\n\n\n<script async data-uid=\"047cbbd566\" src=\"https://waitbutwhy.ck.page/047cbbd566/index.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our <strong><a data-formkit-toggle=\"047cbbd566\" href=\"https://newsletter.waitbutwhy.com/join\">email list</a></strong> and we&#8217;ll send you new posts when they come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support Wait But Why, visit our <strong><a data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" href=\"https://patreon.com/waitbutwhy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Patreon page</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to download this post for printing and offline sharing, you can <a href=\"https://gum.co/wbw-career-path\">buy it here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">___________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For help analyzing your situation:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some paper to write on:</strong> <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WORKSHEET-octopus-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your octopus</a>. <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WORKSHEET-yearning-hierarchy-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your priority shelf</a>. <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WORKSHEET-A-star-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Some path distances</a>. <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WORKSHEET-career-dot-map.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Your career dot map</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For those who want to dig in even further:</strong> Alicia (WBW Manager of Lots of Things) has put together <a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WBW_Career-Path_Worksheet-v4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a more involved group of worksheets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For further exploration:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">80,000 hours</a>\u2014dedicated to helping young, high-potential people make big career choices\u2014is an awesome resource.

They spend almost no time with their immediate family\u2014the Great Apes\u2014and they barely even know the names of their extended family, the rest of the primates. Some humans go so far as to flat out deny any relation to their siblings and cousins. But the fact is, there are 423 other species in the primate order, each of them currently existing and doing something, and we can\u2019t ignore them forever. To bring some rare attention to our forgotten roots, we\u2019re hosting the first annual Primate Awards. Winners will receive either a banana bunch or a grasshopper, depending on their species\u2019 diet. The Primate Awards Most Theatrical Primate Winner: The Sifaka It\u2019s unclear whether the sifaka knows that he\u2019s not actually on a stage and that no one is actually watching him. But his thirst to perform is unquenchable. Primate in the Most Despair Winner: The Colobus On any given day, at any given moment, whatever you\u2019re doing, somewhere out there the colobus is in total despair. We hoped winning this award might cheer him up, but it only made him more crestfallen. Primate Who Would Be Most Shocked If You Gave Them a Mirror Winner: The Mandrill The Mandrill thinks he looks like this: And why would he assume otherwise? Those are normal monkey colors, and as far as he knows, he\u2019s a normal monkey. But he actually looks like a clown: No one has had the guts to say something to him yet, which is probably for the best. Primate With the Most Vacation Days Winner: The Japanese Macaque Every time I see these guys, they\u2019re in the fucking hot tub. Not sure how they pulled this off, but they\u2019ve really got it all worked out. Primate That Could Kind of Pass for an Unattractive, Dumb, Weird-Acting Human Winner: The Bonobo Bonobos are very close to being dumb humans. Look at this dude roasting marshmallows like it\u2019s no big deal. Primate That Would Look Normal Except One Ridiculous Feature Ruins Everything Joint Winners: The Proboscis Monkey and The Uakari Let\u2019s start with the proboscis monkey. Check out the pictures below. Pretty normal monkey, right? Nope! Now check out the uakari. Before you scroll down, try to picture what a normal head might look like. Whatever you pictured, I guarantee it was not a tiny red human fetus head: Disturbing, right? It literally looks like a sixth grader photoshopped a goblin head on top of a monkey photo for a Halloween card. Sassiest Primate Winner: The Baby Orangutan The baby orangutan stunned everyone by taking home the award this year, especially the white-cheeked gibbon , who was unavailable for comment. Primate You\u2019d Want Around Your Daughter the Least Winner: The Patas Monkey That\u2019s not really a face you ever expect to see on a non-human, and it makes the patas monkey the last primate you want anywhere near your daughter. We\u2019d all prefer not to know what goes on in the dark corners of the patas monkey\u2019s mind. Most Appalled Primate Winner: The Indri You\u2019d think by now the indri would have gotten used to the way things are, but he\u2019s still appalled by everything. Most Artistically Tortured Primate Winner: The Cotton-Top Tamarin Narrowly edging out the red-faced spider monkey for the victory, the cotton-top tamarin is a Beethoven-level musical genius, but no one has noticed. Primate With the Most Excessive Face Winner: The Alpha Male Orangutan Christ, alpha male orangutan, get ahold of yourself. This is what happens when evolution is left completely unregulated. For male orangutans, the bigger the face, the better chance of getting laid\u2014and now the male orangutan population has out-faced each other into total absurdity. Biggest Disaster of a Primate Winner: This Particular Alpha Male Orangutan The only primate to win two awards today, this particular alpha male orangutan is just an utter disaster. Most Cartoon-Like Primate Winner: The Tarsier First, let\u2019s take a second to recognize the runner-up, the hapless slow loris. Moving onto the winner, we have the primates\u2019 joke species, the tarsier\u2014 This is the package the tarsier is presenting us with today, apparently finding no need to act like a legitimate creature. Mafia Boss of the Primates The gorilla seems like the obvious choice here, right? Well it turns out that the gorilla is only the henchman for the real mafia boss. Winner: The Ring-Tailed Lemur Most Awkward Color Difference Between Parent and Child Winner: The Silver Langur Whenever you\u2019re with a silver langur, the elephant in the room is that her child is a bright orange, sphere-headed creature blatantly not of the same species. The Silver Langur refuses to acknowledge that anything is weird about the situation, and the rest of us know to just not bring it up. Primate Most Like an Irish Mythical Character Winner: The Golden Lion Tamarin So now we have the elf, the leprechaun, and this little orange gnome of a monkey who sometimes gives you the finger. I would say that owning one would be my ultimate fantasy, but\u2026 Primate I Want to Own More Than I Want Anything Else in the World Winner: The Pygmy Marmoset Are you fucking kidding me with this shit? When I discovered pictures of this creature, I fell deep into a Wikipedia spiral about them, learning among other things that the pygmy marmoset, or finger monkey , is A) smart, even for a monkey, B) lives 12 years or more, and C) can jump up to 16 feet. Living with one would be a dream. Just imagine having dinner together, him at the table in a tiny high chair. Or being together on an airplane, him strapped into a one-inch seatbelt in the seat next to you. You\u2019d tuck him in at night into his bed made from an Altoid tin. This is now the only thing that matters to me. Primate Most Identical to Meryl Streep Winner: The Lesula Monkey Scientists were shocked when in 2007, they discovered this previously unknown monkey that looks and acts exactly like Meryl Streep. Primate Most Identical to Michael Jackson Winner: The Snub-Nosed Monkey Fucked up, right? Primate Most Identical to George W. Bush Winner: The Macaque Moving on\u2026 Most Embarrassing Primate Winner: The White-Faced Saki A true loser, the white-faced saki is someone all primates are ashamed to admit is part of their family. His relatives are also pretty sick of his face looking so detached from the rest of his body. And just when everyone thought things couldn\u2019t get worse, he decided to grow a goatee. Best Disney Movie Bad Guy Primate Winner: The Gelada No photoshopping here\u2014there\u2019s actually a distant cousin of yours that looks that evil. As if his intensely sinister face wasn\u2019t enough, he\u2019s actually wearing a bad guy overcoat at all times. Primate Most Going Through a Terrible Struggle that No One Else Understands Winner: The Aye-Aye No one knows what the aye-aye\u2019s issue is, but he\u2019s really going through some shit. The gollum of the primate world might have an intense paranoia problem, but it also could be that he knows some horrible truth the rest of us don\u2019t. For now, probably a good guy to stay away from.

And with the monkey in charge, the procrastinator finds himself spending a lot of time in a place called the Dark Playground. The Dark Playground is a place every procrastinator knows well. It's a place where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun because it's completely unearned and the air is filled with guilt, anxiety, self-hatred, and dread. Sometimes the Rational Decision-Maker puts his foot down and refuses to let you waste time doing normal leisure things, and since the Instant Gratification Monkey sure as hell isn't gonna let you work, you find yourself in a bizarre purgatory of weird activities where everyone loses.\" This poster is G-rated, so it's\u00a0classroom- and kid-friendly. --------------------- This original Wait But Why poster is printed on acid-, lignin-, and chlorine-free paper that is also pH buffered with calcium carbonate for a true archival sheet. 120 gsm Thickness 5.5 mil ISO Brightness 90% Opacity 94% Due to the fragile nature of the posters and shipping couriers, we will not be able to accept returns on these.

(Or see a preview .) ___________ pro-cras-ti-na-tion |pr\u0259\u02cckrast\u0259\u02c8n\u0101SH\u0259n, pr\u014d-| noun the action of ruining your own life for no apparent reason Let me start by saying that I\u2019ve had just about enough of the irony of battling through crippling procrastination while trying to write posts on procrastination and how to beat it. I\u2019ve spent the last two weeks being this guy , who shoots himself in the foot while talking about gun safety, and I look forward to getting back to irony-free procrastination following this post. A couple notes before we begin: I\u2019m not a professional at any of this, just a lifelong procrastinator who thinks about this topic all the time. I\u2019m still in a total battle with my own habits, but I have made some progress in the last few years, and I\u2019m drawing my thoughts from what\u2019s worked for me. This post was posted late, not only because it took me 2,000 years to do, but also because I decided that Monday night was an urgent time to open Google Earth, hover a few hundred feet above the southern tip of India, and scroll all the way up India to the top of the country, to \u201cget a better feel for India.\u201d I have problems. Alright, so last week we dove into the everyday inner struggle of the procrastinator to examine the underlying psychology going on. But this week, when we\u2019re actually trying to do something about it, we need to dig even deeper. Let\u2019s begin by trying to unwrap the procrastinator\u2019s psychology and see what\u2019s really at the core of things: We know about the Instant Gratification Monkey (the part of your brain that makes you procrastinate) and his dominion over the Rational Decision Maker, but what\u2019s really happening there? The procrastinator is in the bad habit, bordering on addiction, of letting the monkey win. He continues to have the intention to control the monkey, but he puts forth a hapless effort, using the same proven-not-to-work methods he\u2019s used for years, and deep down, he knows the monkey will win. He vows to change, but the patterns just stay the same. So why would an otherwise capable person put forth such a lame and futile effort again and again? The answer is that he has incredibly low confidence when it comes to this part of his life, allowing himself to become enslaved by a self-defeating, self-fulfilling prophecy. Let\u2019s call this self-fulfilling prophecy his Storyline. The procrastinator\u2019s Storyline goes something like this: For the Have-To-Dos in my life, I\u2019ll end up waiting until the last minute, panicking, and then either doing less than my best work or shutting down and not doing anything at all. For the Want-To-Dos in my life, let\u2019s be honest\u2014I\u2019ll either start one and quit or more likely, I just won\u2019t ever get around to it. The procrastinator\u2019s problems run deep, and it takes something more than \u201cbeing more self-disciplined\u201d or \u201cchanging his bad habits\u201d for him to change his ways\u2014 the root of the problem is embedded in his Storyline, and his Storyline is what must change. ___________ Before we talk about how Storylines change, let\u2019s examine, concretely, what the procrastinator even wants to change into . What do the right habits even look like, and where exactly will the procrastinator run into trouble? There are two components of being able to achieve things in a healthy and effective manner\u2014planning and doing. Let\u2019s start with the easy one: Planning Procrastinators love planning, quite simply because planning does not involve doing , and doing is the procrastinator\u2019s Kryptonite. But when procrastinators plan, they like to do it in a vague way that doesn\u2019t consider details or reality too closely, and their planning leaves them perfectly set up to not actually accomplish anything. A procrastinator\u2019s planning session leaves him with a doer\u2019s nightmare: A big list of icky, daunting tasks and undertakings. A big list of vague and daunting things makes the Instant Gratification Monkey laugh. When you make a list like that, the monkey says, \u201cOh perfect, this is easy.\u201d Even if your gullible conscious mind believes it intends to accomplish the items on that list in an efficient manner, the monkey knows that in your subconscious , you have no intention of doing so. Effective planning, on the other hand, sets you up for success . Its purpose is to do the exact opposite of everything in that sentence: Effective planning takes a big list and selects a winner : A big list is perhaps an early phase of planning, but planning must end with rigorous prioritizing and one item that emerges as the winner\u2014the item you\u2019re going to make your first priority. And the item that wins should be the one that means the most to you\u2014the item that\u2019s most important for your happiness. If urgent items are involved, those will have to come first and should be knocked out as quickly as possible in order to make way for the important items (procrastinators love to use unimportant but urgent items as an excuse to forever put off the important ones). Effective planning makes an icky item un-icky : We all know what an icky item is. An icky item is vague and murky, and you\u2019re not really sure where you\u2019d start, how you\u2019d go about doing it, or where you\u2019d get answers to your questions about it. So let\u2019s say your dream is to make your own app, and you know that if you build a successful app you could quit your job and become a full-time developer. You also think that programming ability is the literacy of the 21st century, and you don\u2019t have money to spend outsourcing development anyway, so you decide to anoint \u201cLearn how to code\u201d the winning item on your list\u2014the number one priority. Exciting, right? Well, no, because \u201cLearn how to code\u201d is an intensely icky item\u2014and every time you decide it\u2019s time to get started, you will coincidentally also decide your inbox needs to be cleaned out and your kitchen floor needs to be mopped, ASAP. It\u2019ll never end up happening. To un-icky the item, you need to read, research, and ask questions to find out exactly how one learns how to code, the specific means necessary for each step along the way, and how long each one should take. Un-ickying a list item turns it from this: Into this: Effective planning turns a daunting item into a series of small, clear, manageable tasks : Icky combines with Daunting into an Instant Gratification Monkey steroid potion. And just because you un-icky an item, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s still not horribly big and daunting. The key to de-dauntifying an item is to absorb this fact: A remarkable, glorious achievement is just what a long series of unremarkable, unglorious tasks looks like from far away. No one \u201cbuilds a house.\u201d They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries\u2014they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built\u2014but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built. Nearly every big undertaking can be boiled down to a core unit of progress\u2014its brick. A 45-minute gym visit is the brick of getting in great shape. A 30-minute practice session is the brick of becoming a great guitarist. The average day in a wannabe author\u2019s week and a real author\u2019s week looks almost the same. The real author writes a couple pages, laying a brick, and the wannabe author writes nothing. 98% of their day is otherwise identical. But a year later, the real author has a completed first draft of a book and the wannabe author has\u2026nothing. It\u2019s all about the bricks. And the good news is, laying one brick isn\u2019t daunting. But bricks do require scheduling. So the final step in planning is to make a Brick Timeline, which slots bricks into the calendar. The slots are non-negotiable and non-cancellable\u2014after all, it\u2019s your first priority and the thing that matters most to you, isn\u2019t it? The most important date is the first one. You can\u2019t start learning to code \u201cin November.\u201d But you can start learning to code on November 21st from 6:00 \u2013 7:00pm. Now you\u2019re effectively planned\u2014just follow the schedule and you\u2019ll be a programmer. Only thing left is to do \u2026 Doing It\u2019s not that procrastinators don\u2019t like the concept of doing. They look at the bricks on their calendar and they think, \u201cGreat, this will be fun.\u201d And that\u2019s because when they picture the moment in the future when they sit down and knock out a work session, they picture things without the presence of the Instant Gratification Monkey. Procrastinators\u2019 visions of future scenarios never seem to include the monkey. But when the actual moment arrives to begin that scheduled brick-laying, the procrastinator does what the procrastinator does best\u2014he lets the monkey take over and ruin everything. And since we just stressed above that all achievement boils down to the ability to lay that one brick during that slot when it\u2019s on your schedule, we seem to have isolated the core struggle here. Let\u2019s examine this specific challenge of laying a single brick: So this diagram represents the challenge at hand anytime you take on a task, whether it\u2019s making a PowerPoint for work, going on a jog, working on a script, or anything else you do in your life. The Critical Entrance is where you go to officially start work on the task, the Dark Woods are the process of actually doing the work, and once you finish, you\u2019re rewarded by ending up in The Happy Playground\u2014a place where you feel satisfaction and where leisure time is pleasant and rewarding because you got something hard done. You occasionally even end up super-engaged with what you\u2019re working on and enter a state of Flow , where you\u2019re so blissfully immersed in the task that you lose track of time. Those paths look something like this: Sounds pretty simple, right? Well unfortunately for procrastinators, they tend to miss out on both The Happy Playground and Flow. For example, here\u2019s a procrastinator that never even gets started on the task he\u2019s supposed to do, because he never makes it through the Critical Entrance. Instead, he spends hours wallowing in The Dark Playground, hating himself: Here\u2019s a procrastinator who gets started on the task, but she can\u2019t stay focused, and she keeps taking long breaks to play on the internet and make food. She doesn\u2019t end up finishing the task: Here\u2019s a procrastinator who couldn\u2019t bring himself to get started, even though a work deadline was approaching, and he spent hours in The Dark Playground, knowing the looming deadline was drawing near and he was only making his life harder by not starting. Eventually, the deadline got so close, the Panic Monster suddenly came roaring into the room, freaking him out and causing him to fly through the task to hit the deadline. After he finishes, he feels decent because he accomplished something, but he\u2019s also not that pleased because he knows he did an underwhelming job on the project because he had to rush so much, and he feels like he wasted most of his day procrastinating for no reason. This lands him in Mixed Feelings Park. So if you\u2019re a procrastinator, let\u2019s look at what you need to do to get on the right path, one that will leave you much happier. The first thing you must do is make it through the Critical Entrance. This means stopping whatever you\u2019re doing when it\u2019s time to begin the task, putting away all distractions, and getting started. It sounds simple, but this is the hardest part. This is where the Instant Gratification Monkey puts up his fiercest resistance: The monkey absolutely hates stopping something fun to start something hard, and this is where you need to be the strongest. If you can get started and force the monkey into the Dark Woods, you\u2019ve broken a bit of his will. Of course, he\u2019s not going to give up anytime soon. The Dark Woods is where you are when you\u2019re working. It\u2019s not a fun place to be, and the Instant Gratification Monkey wants nothing to do with it. To make things harder, the Dark Woods is surrounded by the Dark Playground, one of the monkey\u2019s favorite places, and since he can see how close it is, he\u2019ll try as hard as he can to leave the Dark Woods. There will also be times when you bump into a tree\u2014maybe the jog is taking you on an uphill street, maybe you need to use an Excel formula you don\u2019t know, maybe that song you\u2019re writing just isn\u2019t coming together the way you thought it would\u2014and this is when the monkey will make his boldest attempt at an escape. It makes no sense to leave the Dark Woods in favor of the Dark Playground\u2014they\u2019re both dark. They both suck to be in, but the big difference is the Dark Woods leads to happiness and the Dark Playground leads only to more misery. But the Instant Gratification Monkey isn\u2019t logical and to him, the Dark Playground seems like much more fun. The good news is, if you can power through a bit of the Dark Woods, something funny happens. Making progress on a task produces positive feelings of accomplishment and raises your self-esteem. The monkey gains his strength off of low self-esteem, and when you feel a jolt of self-satisfaction, the monkey finds a High Self-Esteem Banana in his path. It doesn\u2019t quell his resistance entirely, but it goes a long way to distracting him for a while, and you\u2019ll find that the urge to procrastinate has diminished. Then, if you continue along, something magical happens. Once you get 2/3 or 3/4 of the way through a task, especially if it\u2019s going well, you start to feel great about things and suddenly, the end is in sight. This is a key tipping point\u2014 The Tipping Point is important because it\u2019s not just you who can smell the Happy Playground up ahead\u2014 the monkey can smell it too . The monkey doesn\u2019t care if his instant gratification comes alongside you or at your expense, he just loves things that are easy and fun. Once you hit the Tipping Point, the monkey becomes more interested in getting to the Happy Playground than the Dark Playground. When this happens, you lose all impulse to procrastinate and now both you and the monkey are speeding toward the finish. Before you know it, you\u2019re done, and you\u2019re in the Happy Playground. Now, for the first time in a while, you and the monkey are a team. You both want to have fun, and it feels great because it\u2019s earned . When you and the monkey are on a team, you\u2019re almost always happy. The other thing that might happen when you pass the Tipping Point, depending on the type of task and how well it\u2019s going, is that you might start feeling fantastic about what you\u2019re working on, so fantastic that continuing to work sounds like much more fun than stopping to do leisure activities. You\u2019ve become obsessed with the task and you lose interest in basically everything else, including food and time\u2014this is called Flow. Flow is not only a blissful feeling, it\u2019s usually when you do great things. The monkey is just as addicted to the bliss as you are, and you two are again a team. Fighting through to the Tipping Point is hard, but what makes procrastination so hard to beat is that the Instant Gratification Monkey has a terribly short-term memory\u2014even if you wildly succeed on Monday, when you begin a task on Tuesday, the monkey has forgotten everything and will again resist entering the Dark Woods or working through them. And that\u2019s why persistence is such a critical component of success. Laying each brick yields an inner struggle\u2014and in the end, your ability to win this very specific struggle and lay brick after brick, day after day, is what lies at the core of a procrastinator\u2019s struggle to gain control over his world. So that\u2019s what needs to happen\u2014but if procrastination could be solved by reading a blog entry, it wouldn\u2019t be such a large problem in so many people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s only one way to truly beat procrastination: You need to prove to yourself that you can do it. You need to show yourself you can do it, not tell yourself. Things will change when you show yourself that they can. Until then, you won\u2019t believe it, and nothing will change. Think of yourself like a basketball player on a cold streak. For basketball players, it\u2019s all about confidence, and an ice cold shooter can tell himself 1000 times, \u201cI\u2019m a great shooter, I\u2019m going to hit this next one,\u201d but it\u2019s not until he physically hits a shot that his confidence goes up and his touch comes back. So how do you start hitting shots? 1) Try to internalize the fact that everything you do is a choice. Start by thinking about the terms we\u2019ve used in these posts, and if they resonated with you, write them down. Part of the reason I assigned terms to so many of these feelings or phenomena\u2014the Instant Gratification Monkey, the Rational Decision-Maker, the Panic Monster, the Dark Playground, Ickiness, Bricks, the Critical Entrance, the Dark Woods, the Tipping Point, the Happy Playground, Flow, your Storyline\u2014is that terms help you clarify the reality of the choices you\u2019re making. It helps expose bad choices and highlights when it\u2019s most critical to make good ones. 2) Create methods to help you defeat the monkey. Some possible methods: Solicit external support by telling one or more friends or family members about a goal you\u2019re trying to accomplish and asking them to hold you to it. If that\u2019s hard for whatever reason, email it to me\u2014I\u2019m a stranger ( [email\u00a0protected] )\u2014and just typing out a goal and sending it to a real person can help make it more real. (Some experts argue that telling people in your life about a goal can be counterproductive, so this depends on your particular situation.) Create a Panic Monster if there\u2019s not already one in place\u2014if you\u2019re trying to finish an album, schedule a performance for a few months from now, book a space, and send out an invitation to a group of people. If you really want to start a business, quitting your job makes the Panic Monster your new roommate. If you\u2019re trying to write a consistent blog, put \u201cnew post every Tuesday\u201d at the top of the page\u2026 Leave post-it notes for yourself, reminding you to make good choices. Set an alarm to remind yourself to start a task, or to remind you of the stakes. Minimize distractions by all means necessary. If TV\u2019s a huge problem, sell your TV. If the internet\u2019s a huge problem, get a second computer for work that has Wifi disabled, and turn your phone on Airplane Mode during work sessions. Lock yourself into something\u2014put down a non-refundable deposit for lessons or a membership. And if the methods you set up aren\u2019t working, change them. Set a reminder for a month from now that says, \u201cHave things improved? If not, change my methods.\u201d 3) Aim for slow, steady progress\u2014Storylines are rewritten one page at a time. In the same way a great achievement happens unglorious brick by unglorious brick, a deeply-engrained habit like procrastination doesn\u2019t change all at once, it changes one modest improvement at a time. Remember, this is all about showing yourself you can do it, so the key isn\u2019t to be perfect, but to simply improve . The author who writes one page a day has written a book after a year. The procrastinator who gets slightly better every week is a totally changed person a year later. So don\u2019t think about going from A to Z\u2014just start with A to B. Change the Storyline from \u201cI procrastinate on every hard task I do\u201d to \u201cOnce a week, I do a hard task without procrastinating.\u201d If you can do that, you\u2019ve started a trend . I\u2019m still a wretched procrastinator, but I\u2019m definitely better than I was last year, so I feel hopeful about the future. Why do I think about this topic so much, and why did I just write a 3,500-word blog post on it? Because defeating procrastination is the same thing as gaining control over your own life. So much of what makes people happy or unhappy\u2014their level of fulfillment and satisfaction, their self-esteem, the regrets they carry with them, the amount of free time they have to dedicate to their relationships\u2014is severely affected by procrastination. So it\u2019s worthy of being taken dead seriously, and the time to start improving is now. ____________ The follow-up to these two posts: The Procrastination Matrix And two more related posts: Why you shouldn\u2019t care what other people think .

Buy it here. Part 1: Meet Your Mammoth The first day I was in second grade, I came to school and noticed that there was a new, very pretty girl in the class\u2014someone who hadn\u2019t been there the previous two years. Her name was Alana and within an hour, she was everything to me. When you\u2019re seven, there aren\u2019t really any actionable steps you can take when you\u2019re in love with someone. You\u2019re not even sure what you want from the situation. There\u2019s just this amorphous yearning that\u2019s a part of your life, and that\u2019s that. But for me, it became suddenly relevant a few months later, when during recess one day, one of the girls in the class started asking each of the boys, \u201cWho do youuu want to marry?\u201d When she asked me, it was a no-brainer. \u201cAlana.\u201d Disaster. I was still new to being a human and didn\u2019t realize that the only socially acceptable answer was, \u201cNo one.\u201d The second I answered, the heinous girl ran toward other students, telling each one, \u201cTim said he wants to marry Alana! \u201d Each person she told covered their mouth with uncontrollable laughter. I was finished. Life was over. The news quickly got back to Alana herself, who stayed as far away from me as possible for days after. If she knew what a restraining order was, she\u2019d have taken one out. This horrifying experience taught me a critical life lesson\u2014it can be mortally dangerous to be yourself, and you should exercise extreme social caution at all times. Now this sounds like something only a traumatized second grader would think, but the weird thing, and the topic of this post, is that this lesson isn\u2019t just limited to me and my debacle of a childhood\u2014 it\u2019s a defining paranoia of the human species. We share a collective insanity that pervades human cultures throughout the world: An irrational and unproductive obsession with what other people think of us. Evolution does everything for a reason, and to understand the origin of this particular insanity, let\u2019s back up for a minute to 50,000BC in Ethiopia, where your Great 2,000 Grandfather lived as part of a small tribe. Back then, being part of a tribe was critical to survival. A tribe meant food and protection in a time when neither was easy to come by. So for your Great 2,000 Grandfather, almost nothing in the world was more important than being accepted by his fellow tribe members, especially those in positions of authority. Fitting in with those around him and pleasing those above him meant he could stay in the tribe, and about the worst nightmare he could imagine would be people in the tribe starting to whisper about how annoying or unproductive or weird he was\u2014because if enough people disapproved of him, his ranking within the tribe would drop, and if it got really bad, he\u2019d be kicked out altogether and left for dead. He also knew that if he ever embarrassed himself by pursuing a girl in the tribe and being rejected, she\u2019d tell the other girls about it\u2014not only would he have blown his chance with that girl, but he might never have a mate at all now because every girl that would ever be in his life knew about his lame, failed attempt. Being socially accepted was everything . Because of this, humans evolved an over-the-top obsession with what others thought of them\u2014a craving for social approval and admiration, and a paralyzing fear of being disliked. Let\u2019s call that obsession a human\u2019s Social Survival Mammoth. It looks something like this: Your Great 2,000 Grandfather\u2019s Social Survival Mammoth was central to his ability to endure and thrive. It was simple\u2014keep the mammoth well fed with social approval and pay close attention to its overwhelming fears of nonacceptance, and you\u2019ll be fine. And that was all well and fine in 50,000BC. And 30,000BC. And 10,000BC. But something funny has happened for humans in the last 10,000 years\u2014their civilization has dramatically changed. Sudden, quick change is something civilization has the ability to do, and the reason that can be awkward is that our evolutionary biology can\u2019t move nearly as fast. So while for most of history, both our social structure and our biology evolved and adjusted at a snail\u2019s pace together, civilization has recently developed the speed capabilities of a hare while our biology has continued snailing along. Our bodies and minds are built to live in a tribe in 50,000BC, which leaves modern humans with a number of unfortunate traits, one of which is a fixation with tribal-style social survival in a world where social survival is no longer a real concept. We\u2019re all here in 2014, accompanied by a large, hungry, and easily freaked-out woolly mammoth who still thinks it\u2019s 50,000BC. Why else would you try on four outfits and still not be sure what to wear before going out? The mammoth\u2019s nightmares about romantic rejection made your ancestors cautious and savvy, but in today\u2019s world, it just makes you a coward: And don\u2019t even get the mammoth started on the terror of artistic risks: The mammoth\u2019s hurricane of fear of social disapproval plays a factor in most parts of most people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s what makes you feel weird about going to a restaurant or a movie alone; it\u2019s what makes parents care a little too much about where their child goes to college; it\u2019s what makes you pass up a career you\u2019d love in favor of a more lucrative career you\u2019re lukewarm about; it\u2019s what makes you get married before you\u2019re ready to a person you\u2019re not in love with. And while keeping your highly insecure Social Survival Mammoth feeling calm and safe takes a lot of work, that\u2019s only one half of your responsibilities. The mammoth also needs to be fed regularly and robustly\u2014with praise, approval, and the feeling of being on the right side of any social or moral dichotomy. Why else would you be such an image-crafting douchebag on Facebook? Or brag when you\u2019re out with friends even though you always regret it later? Society has evolved to accommodate this mammoth-feeding frenzy, inventing things like accolades and titles and the concept of prestige in order to keep our mammoths satisfied\u2014and often to incentivize people to do meaningless jobs and live unfulfilling lives they wouldn\u2019t otherwise consider taking part in. Above all, mammoths want to fit in\u2014that\u2019s what tribespeople had always needed to do so that\u2019s how they\u2019re programmed. Mammoths look around at society to figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do, and when it becomes clear, they jump right in. Just look at any two college fraternity pictures taken ten years apart: Or all those subcultures where every single person has one of the same three socially-acceptable advanced degrees: Sometimes, a mammoth\u2019s focus isn\u2019t on wider society as much as it\u2019s on winning the approval of a Puppet Master in your life. A Puppet Master is a person or group of people whose opinion matters so much to you that they\u2019re essentially running your life. A Puppet Master is often a parent, or maybe your significant other, or sometimes an alpha member of your group of friends. A Puppet Master can be a person you look up to who you don\u2019t know very well\u2014maybe even a celebrity you\u2019ve never met\u2014or a group of people you hold in especially high regard. We crave the Puppet Master\u2019s approval more than anyone\u2019s, and we\u2019re so horrified at the thought of upsetting the Puppet Master or feeling their nonacceptance or ridicule that we\u2019ll do anything to avoid it. When we get to this toxic state in our relationship with a Puppet Master, that person\u2019s presence hangs over our entire decision-making process and pulls the strings of our opinions and our moral voice. With so much thought and energy dedicated to the mammoth\u2019s needs, you often end up neglecting someone else in your brain, someone all the way at the center\u2014your Authentic Voice. Your Authentic Voice, somewhere in there, knows all about you. In contrast to the black-and-white simplicity of the Social Survival Mammoth, your Authentic Voice is complex, sometimes hazy, constantly evolving, and unafraid. Your AV has its own, nuanced moral code, formed by experience, reflection, and its own personal take on compassion and integrity. It knows how you feel deep down about things like money and family and marriage, and it knows which kinds of people, topics of interest, and types of activities you truly enjoy, and which you don\u2019t. Your AV knows that it doesn\u2019t know how your life will or should play out, but it tends to have a strong hunch about the right step to take next. And while the mammoth looks only to the outside world in its decision-making process, your Authentic Voice uses the outside world to learn and gather information, but when it\u2019s time for a decision, it has all the tools it needs right there in the core of your brain. Your AV is also someone the mammoth tends to ignore entirely. A strong opinion from a confident person in the outside world? The mammoth is all ears. But a passionate plea from your AV is largely dismissed until someone else validates it. And since our 50,000-year-old brains are wired to give the mammoth a whole lot of sway in things, your Authentic Voice starts to feel like it\u2019s irrelevant. Which makes it shrink and fade and lose motivation. Eventually, a mammoth-run person can lose touch with their AV entirely. In tribal times, AVs often spent their lives in quiet obscurity, and this was largely okay. Life was simple, and conformity was the goal\u2014and the mammoth had conformity covered just fine. But in today\u2019s large, complex world of varying cultures and personalities and opportunities and options, losing touch with your AV is dangerous. When you don\u2019t know who you are, the only decision-making mechanism you\u2019re left with is the crude and outdated needs and emotions of your mammoth. When it comes to the most personal questions, instead of digging deep into the foggy center of what you really believe in to find clarity, you\u2019ll look to others for the answers. Who you are becomes some blend of the strongest opinions around you. Losing touch with your AV also makes you fragile, because when your identity is built on the approval of others, being criticized or rejected by others really hurts. A bad break-up is painful for everyone, but it stings in a much deeper place for a mammoth-run person than for a person with a strong AV. A strong AV makes a stable core, and after a break-up, that core is still holding firm\u2014but since the acceptance of others is all a mammoth-run person has, being dumped by a person who knows you well is a far more shattering experience. Likewise, you know those people who react to being criticized by coming back with a nasty low-blow? Those tend to be severely mammoth-run people, and criticism makes them so mad because mammoths cannot handle criticism. At this point, the mission should be clear\u2014we need to figure out a way to override the wiring of our brain and tame the mammoth. That\u2019s the only way to take our lives back. Part 2: Taming the Mammoth Some people are born with a reasonably tame mammoth or raised with parenting that helps keep the mammoth in check. Others die without ever reining their mammoth in at all, spending their whole lives at its whim. Most of us are somewhere in the middle\u2014we\u2019ve got control of our mammoth in certain areas of our lives while it wreaks havoc in others. Being run by your mammoth doesn\u2019t make you a bad or weak person\u2014it just means you haven\u2019t yet figured out how to get a grip on it. You might not even be aware that you have a mammoth at all or of the extent to which your Authentic Voice has been silenced. Whatever your situation, there are three steps to getting your mammoth under your control: Step 1: Examine Yourself The first step to improving things is a clear and honest assessment of what\u2019s going on in your head, and there are three parts of this: 1) Get to know your Authentic Voice This doesn\u2019t sound that hard, but it is. It takes some serious reflection to sift through the webs of other people\u2019s thoughts and opinions and figure out who the real you actually is. You spend time with a lot of people\u2014which of them do you actually like the most? How do you spend your leisure time, and do you truly enjoy all parts of it? Is there anything you regularly spend money on that you don\u2019t feel that comfortable with? How does your gut really feel about your job and relationship status? What\u2019s your true political opinion? Do you even care? Do you pretend to care about things you don\u2019t just to have an opinion? Do you secretly have an opinion on a political or moral issue you don\u2019t ever voice because people you know will be outraged? There are clich\u00e9 phrases for this process\u2014\u201dsoul-searching\u201d or \u201cfinding yourself\u201d\u2014but that\u2019s exactly what needs to happen. Maybe you can reflect on this from whatever chair you\u2019re sitting in right now or from some other part of your normal life\u2014or maybe you need to go somewhere far away, by yourself, and step out of your life in order to effectively examine it. Either way, you\u2019ve got to figure out what actually matters to you and start being proud of whoever your Authentic Voice is. 2) Figure out where the mammoth is hiding Most of the time a mammoth is in control of a person, the person\u2019s not really aware of it. But you can\u2019t make progress if you\u2019re not crystal clear about where the biggest problem areas are. The most obvious way to find the mammoth is to figure out where your fear is \u2014where are you most susceptible to shame or embarrassment? What parts of your life do you think about and a dreadful, sinking feeling washes over you? Where does the prospect of failure seem like a nightmare? What are you too timid to publicly try even though you know you\u2019re good at it? If you were giving advice to yourself, which parts of your life would clearly need a change that you\u2019re avoiding acting on right now? The second place a mammoth hides is in the way-too-good feelings you get from feeling accepted or on a pedestal over other people. Are you a serious pleaser at work or in your relationship? Are you terrified of disappointing your parents and do you choose making them proud over aiming to gratify yourself? Do you get too excited about being associated with prestigious things or care too much about status? Do you brag more than you should? A third area the mammoth is present is anywhere you don\u2019t feel comfortable making a decision without \u201cpermission\u201d or approval from others. Do you have opinions you\u2019re regurgitating from someone else\u2019s mouth, which you\u2019re comfortable having now that you know that person has them? When you introduce your new girlfriend or boyfriend to your friends or family for the first time, can those people\u2019s reaction to your new person fundamentally change your feelings for him/her? Is there a Puppet Master in your life? If so, who, and why? 3) Decide where the mammoth needs to be ousted It\u2019s not realistic to kick the mammoth entirely out of your head\u2014you\u2019re a human and humans have mammoths in their head, period. The thing we all need to do is carve out certain sacred areas of our lives that must be in the hands of the AV and free of mammoth influence. There are obvious areas that need to be made part of the AV\u2019s domain like your choice of life partner, your career path, and the way you raise your kids. Others are personal\u2014it comes down to the question, \u201cIn which parts of your life must you be entirely true to yourself?\u201d Step 2: Gather Courage by Internalizing That the Mammoth Has a Low IQ Real Woolly Mammoths were unimpressive enough to go extinct, and Social Survival Mammoths aren\u2019t any better. Despite the fact that they haunt us so, our mammoths are dumb, primitive creatures who have no understanding of the modern world. Deeply understanding this\u2014and internalizing it\u2014is a key step to taming yours. There are two major reasons not to take your mammoth seriously: 1) The mammoth\u2019s fears are totally irrational. 5 things the Mammoth is incorrect about: \u2192 Everyone is talking about me and my life and just think how much everyone will be talking about it if I do this risky or weird thing. Here\u2019s how the mammoth thinks things are: Here\u2019s how things actually are: No one really cares that much about what you\u2019re doing. People are highly self-absorbed. \u2192 If I try really hard, I can please everyone. Yes, maybe in a 40-person tribe with a unified culture. But in today\u2019s world, no matter who you are, a bunch of people will like you and a bunch of other people won\u2019t. Being approved of by one type of person means turning another off. So obsessing over fitting in with any one group is illogical, especially if that group isn\u2019t really who you are. You\u2019ll do all that work, and meanwhile, your actual favorite people are off being friends with each other somewhere else. \u2192 Being disapproved of or looked down upon or shit-talked about has real consequences in my life. Anyone who disapproves of who you\u2019re being or what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t even in the same room with you 99.7% of the time. It\u2019s a classic mammoth mistake to fabricate a vision of future social consequences that is way worse than what actually ends up happening\u2014which is usually nothing at all. \u2192 Really judgy people matter. Here\u2019s how judgy people function: They\u2019re highly mammoth-controlled and become good friends with and date other judgy people who are also highly mammoth-controlled. One of the primary activities they do together is talk shit about whoever\u2019s not with them\u2014maybe they feel some jealousy, and eye-rolling disapproval helps them flip the script and feel less jealous, or maybe they\u2019re not jealous and use someone as a vehicle for bathing in schadenfreude \u2014but whatever the underlying feeling, the judging serves to feed their hungry mammoth. When people shit-talk, they set up a category division of which they\u2019re always on the right side. They do this to prop themselves up on a pedestal that their mammoth can chomp away on. Being the material a judgy person uses to feel good about themselves is a fairly infuriating thought\u2014but it has no actual consequences and it\u2019s clearly all much more about the judgy person and their mammoth problem than it is about you. If you find yourself making decisions partially based on not being talked badly about by a judgy person, think hard about what\u2019s actually going on and stop. \u2192 I\u2019m a bad person if I disappoint or offend the person/people who love me and have invested so much in me. No. You\u2019re not a bad person for being whoever your Authentic Voice is in your one life. This is one of those simple things\u2014if they truly selflessly love you, they will for sure come around and accept everything once they see that you\u2019re happy. If you\u2019re happy and they still don\u2019t come around, here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: their strong feelings about who you should be or what you should do are their mammoth talking , and their main motivation is worrying about how it\u2019ll \u201clook\u201d to other people who know them. They\u2019re allowing their mammoth to override their love for you, and they should be adamantly ignored. Two other reasons why the mammoth\u2019s fearful obsession with social approval makes no sense: A) You live here: So who gives a fuck about anything? B) You and everyone you know are going to die. Kind of soon. So like\u2026yeah. The mammoth\u2019s fears being irrational is one reason the mammoth has a low IQ. Here\u2019s the second: 2) The mammoth\u2019s efforts are counterproductive. The irony of the whole thing is that the obsessive lumbering mammoth isn\u2019t even good at his job. His methods of winning approval may have been effective in simpler times, but today, they\u2019re transparent and off-putting. The modern world is an AV\u2019s world, and if the mammoth wants to thrive socially, he should do the thing that scares him most\u2014let the AV take over. Here\u2019s why: AVs are interesting. Mammoths are boring. Every AV is unique and complex, which is inherently interesting. Mammoths are all the same\u2014they copy and conform, and their motives aren\u2019t based on anything authentic or real, just on doing what they think they\u2019re supposed to do. That\u2019s supremely boring. AVs lead. Mammoths follow. Leadership is natural for most AVs, because they draw their thoughts and opinions from an original place, which gives them an original angle. And if they\u2019re smart and innovative enough, they can change things in the world and invent things that disrupt the status quo. If you give someone a paintbrush and an empty canvas, they might not paint something good\u2014but they\u2019ll change the canvas in one way or another. Mammoths, on the other hand, follow\u2014by definition. That\u2019s what they were built to do\u2014blend in and follow the leader. The last thing a mammoth is going to do is change the status quo because it\u2019s trying so hard to be the status quo. When you give someone a paintbrush and canvas, but the paint is the same exact color as the canvas, they can paint all they want, but they won\u2019t change anything. People gravitate toward AVs, not mammoths. The only time a mammoth-crazed person is appealing on a first date is when they\u2019re on the date with another mammoth-crazed person. People with a strong AV see through mammoth-controlled people and aren\u2019t attracted to them. A friend of mine was dating a great on-paper guy awhile back but broke things off because she couldn\u2019t quite fall for him. She tried to articulate why, saying he wasn\u2019t weird or special enough\u2014he seemed like \u201cjust one of the guys.\u201d In other words, he was being run too much by a mammoth. This also holds among friends or colleagues, where AV-run people are more respected and more magnetic\u2014not because there\u2019s necessarily anything extraordinary about them, but because people respect someone with the strength of character to have tamed their mammoth. Step 3: Start Being Yourself This post was all fun and games until \u201cstart being yourself\u201d came into the picture. Up to now, this has been an interesting reflection into why humans care so much what other people think, why that\u2019s bad, how it\u2019s a problem in your life, and why there\u2019s no good reason it should continue to plague you. But actually doing something after you finish reading this article is a whole different thing. That takes more than reflection\u2014it takes some courage. But courage against what, exactly? As we\u2019ve discussed, there\u2019s no actual danger involved in being yourself\u2014more than anything, it just takes an Emperor Has No Clothes epiphany, which is as simple as this: Almost nothing you\u2019re socially scared of is actually scary. Absorbing this thought will diminish the fear that you feel, and without fear, the mammoth loses some power. With a weakened mammoth, it becomes possible to begin standing up for who you are and even making some bold changes\u2014and when you watch those changes turn out well for you with few negative consequences and no regrets, it reinforces the epiphany and an empowered AV becomes a habit. Your mammoth has now lost its ability to pull the strings, and it\u2019s tamed. The mammoth is still with you\u2014it\u2019ll always be with you\u2014but you\u2019ll have an easier time ignoring or overruling it when it speaks up or acts out, because the AV is the alpha dog now. You can start to relish the feeling of being viewed as weird or inappropriate or confusing to people, and society becomes your playground and blank canvas, not something to grovel before and hope for acceptance from. Making this shift isn\u2019t easy for anyone, but it\u2019s worth obsessing over. Your Authentic Voice has been given one life\u2014and it\u2019s your job to make sure it gets the opportunity to live it. _________ You can buy the PDF of this post for offline sharing, or get your own Social Survival Mammoth here : _________ More on life and happiness from Wait But Why A different struggle going on in another part of your brain \u2013 Why Procrastinators Procrastinate The thing I learned from Elon Musk that changed the way I think about my life: The Cook and the Chef: Musk\u2019s Secret Sauce A deeper look at the deal with the mammoth and the other animals in your brain.

You can buy it here . The mind\u2026can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. \u2015 John Milton The mind is certainly its own cosmos. \u2014 Alan Lightman You go to school, study hard, get a degree, and you\u2019re pleased with yourself. But are you wiser? You get a job, achieve things at the job, gain responsibility, get paid more, move to a better company, gain even more responsibility, get paid even more, rent an apartment with a parking spot, stop doing your own laundry, and you buy one of those $9 juices where the stuff settles down to the bottom. But are you happier? You do all kinds of life things\u2014you buy groceries, read articles, get haircuts, chew things, take out the trash, buy a car, brush your teeth, shit, sneeze, shave, stretch, get drunk, put salt on things, have sex with someone, charge your laptop, jog, empty the dishwasher, walk the dog, buy a couch, close the curtains, button your shirt, wash your hands, zip your bag, set your alarm, fix your hair, order lunch, act friendly to someone, watch a movie, drink apple juice, and put a new paper towel roll on the thing. But as you do these things day after day and year after year, are you improving as a human in a meaningful way? In the last post , I described the way my own path had led me to be an atheist\u2014but how in my satisfaction with being proudly nonreligious, I never gave serious thought to an active approach to internal improvement\u2014hindering my own evolution in the process. This wasn\u2019t just my own naivet\u00e9 at work. Society at large focuses on shallow things, so it doesn\u2019t stress the need to take real growth seriously. The major institutions in the spiritual arena\u2014religions\u2014tend to focus on divinity over people, making salvation the end goal instead of self-improvement. The industries that do often focus on the human condition\u2014philosophy, psychology, art, literature, self-help, etc.\u2014lie more on the periphery, with their work often fragmented from each other. All of this sets up a world that makes it hard to treat internal growth as anything other than a hobby, an extra-curricular, icing on the life cake. Considering that the human mind is an ocean of complexity that creates every part of our reality, working on what\u2019s going on in there seems like it should be a more serious priority. In the same way a growing business relies on a clear mission with a well thought-out strategy and measurable metrics, a growing human needs a plan \u2014if we want to meaningfully improve, we need to define a goal, understand how to get there, become aware of obstacles in the way, and have a strategy to get past them. When I dove into this topic, I thought about my own situation and whether I was improving. The efforts were there\u2014apparent in many of this blog\u2019s post topics\u2014but I had no growth model, no real plan, no clear mission. Just kind of haphazard attempts at self-improvement in one area or another, whenever I happened to feel like it. So I\u2019ve attempted to consolidate my scattered efforts, philosophies, and strategies into a single framework\u2014something solid I can hold onto in the future\u2014and I\u2019m gonna use this post to do a deep dive into it. So settle in, grab some coffee, and get your brain out and onto the table in front of you\u2014you\u2019ll want to have it there to reference as we explore what a weird, complicated object it is. ____________ The Goal Wisdom. More on that later. How Do We Get to the Goal? By being aware of the truth. When I say \u201cthe truth,\u201d I\u2019m not being one of those annoying people who says the word truth to mean some amorphous, mystical thing\u2014I\u2019m just referring to the actual facts of reality. The truth is a combination of what we know and what we don\u2019t know\u2014and gaining and maintaining awareness of both sides of this reality is the key to being wise. Easy, right? We don\u2019t have to know more than we know, we only have to be aware of what we know and what we don\u2019t know. Truth is in plain sight, written on the whiteboard\u2014we just have to look at the board and reflect upon it. There\u2019s just this one thing\u2014 What\u2019s in Our Way? The fog. To understand the fog, let\u2019s first be clear that we\u2019re not here: We\u2019re here: And this isn\u2019t the situation: This is: This is a really hard concept for humans to absorb, but it\u2019s the starting place for growth. Declaring ourselves \u201cconscious\u201d allows us to call it a day and stop thinking about it. I like to think of it as a consciousness staircase: An ant is more conscious than a bacterium, a chicken more than an ant, a monkey more than a chicken, and a human more than a monkey. But what\u2019s above us? A) Definitely something, and B) Nothing we can understand better than a monkey can understand our world and how we think. There\u2019s no reason to think the staircase doesn\u2019t extend upwards forever. The red alien a few steps above us on the staircase would see human consciousness the same way we see that of an orangutan\u2014they might think we\u2019re pretty impressive for an animal, but that of course we don\u2019t actually begin to understand anything. Our most brilliant scientist would be outmatched by one of their toddlers. To the green alien up there higher on the staircase, the red alien might seem as intelligent and conscious as a chicken seems to us. And when the green alien looks at us , it sees the simplest little pre-programmed ants. We can\u2019t conceive of what life higher on the staircase would be like, but absorbing the fact that higher stairs exist and trying to view ourselves from the perspective of one of those steps is the key mindset we need to be in for this exercise. For now, let\u2019s ignore those much higher steps and just focus on the step right above us\u2014that light green step. A species on that step might think of us like we think of a three-year-old child\u2014 emerging into consciousness through a blur of simplicity and naivet\u00e9. Let\u2019s imagine that a representative from that species was sent to observe humans and report back to his home planet about them\u2014what would he think of the way we thought and behaved? What about us would impress him? What would make him cringe? I think he\u2019d very quickly see a conflict going on in the human mind. On one hand, all of those steps on the staircase below the human are where we grew from. Hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary adaptations geared toward animal survival in a rough world are very much rooted in our DNA, and the primitive impulses in us have birthed a bunch of low-grade qualities\u2014fear, pettiness, jealousy, greed, instant-gratification, etc. Those qualities are the remnants of our animal past and still a prominent part of our brains, creating a zoo of small-minded emotions and motivations in our heads: But over the past six million years, our evolutionary line has experienced a rapid growth in consciousness and the incredible ability to reason in a way no other species on Earth can. We\u2019ve taken a big step up the consciousness staircase, very quickly\u2014let\u2019s call this burgeoning element of higher consciousness our Higher Being. The Higher Being is brilliant, big-thinking, and totally rational. But on the grand timescale, he\u2019s a very new resident in our heads, while the primal animal forces are ancient, and their coexistence in the human mind makes it a strange place: So it\u2019s not that a human is the Higher Being and the Higher Being is three years old\u2014it\u2019s that a human is the combination of the Higher Being and the low-level animals, and they blend into the three-year-old that we are. The Higher Being alone would be a more advanced species, and the animals alone would be one far more primitive, and it\u2019s their particular coexistence that makes us distinctly human. As humans evolved and the Higher Being began to wake up, he looked around your brain and found himself in an odd and unfamiliar jungle full of powerful primitive creatures that didn\u2019t understand who or what he was. His mission was to give you clarity and high-level thought, but with animals tramping around his work environment, it wasn\u2019t an easy job. And things were about to get much worse. Human evolution continued to make the Higher Being more and more sentient, until one day, he realized something shocking: WE\u2019RE GOING TO DIE It marked the first time any species on planet Earth was conscious enough to understand that fact, and it threw all of those animals in the brain\u2014who were not built to handle that kind of information\u2014into a complete frenzy, sending the whole ecosystem into chaos: The animals had never experienced this kind of fear before, and their freakout about this\u2014one that continues today\u2014was the last thing the Higher Being needed as he was trying to grow and learn and make decisions for us. The adrenaline-charged animals romping around our brain can take over our mind, clouding our thoughts, judgment, sense of self, and understanding of the world. The collective force of the animals is what I call \u201cthe fog.\u201d The more the animals are running the show and making us deaf and blind to the thoughts and insights of the Higher Being, the thicker the fog is around our head, often so thick we can only see a few inches in front of our face: Let\u2019s think back to our goal above and our path to it\u2014being aware of the truth. The Higher Being can see the truth just fine in almost any situation. But when the fog is thick around us, blocking our eyes and ears and coating our brain, we have no access to the Higher Being or his insight. This is why being continually aware of the truth is so hard\u2014we\u2019re too lost in the fog to see it or think about it. And when the alien representative is finished observing us and heads back to his home planet, I think this would be his sum-up of our problems: The battle of the Higher Being against the animals\u2014of trying to see through the fog to clarity\u2014is the core internal human struggle. This struggle in our heads takes place on many fronts. We\u2019ve examined a few of them here: the Higher Being (in his role as the Rational Decision Maker) fighting the Instant Gratification Monkey ; the Higher Being (in the role of the Authentic Voice) battling against the overwhelmingly scared Social Survival Mammoth ; the Higher Being\u2019s message that life is just a bunch of Todays getting lost in the blinding light of fog-based yearning for better tomorrows. Those are all part of the same core conflict between our primal past and our enlightened future. The shittiest thing about the fog is that when you\u2019re in the fog, it blocks your vision so you can\u2019t see that you\u2019re in the fog. It\u2019s when the fog is thickest that you\u2019re the least aware that it\u2019s there at all\u2014it makes you unconscious . Being aware that the fog exists and learning how to recognize it is the key first step to rising up in consciousness and becoming a wiser person. So we\u2019ve established that our goal is wisdom, that to get there we need to become as aware as possible of the truth, and that the main thing standing in our way is the fog. Let\u2019s zoom in on the battlefield to look at why \u201cbeing aware of the truth\u201d is so important and how we can overcome the fog to get there: The Battlefield No matter how hard we tried, it would be impossible for humans to access that light green step one above us on the consciousness staircase. Our advanced capability\u2014the Higher Being\u2014just isn\u2019t there yet. Maybe in a million years or two. For now, the only place this battle can happen is on the one step where we live, so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to zoom in. We need to focus on the mini spectrum of consciousness within our step, which we can do by breaking our step down into four substeps: Climbing this mini consciousness staircase is the road to truth, the way to wisdom, my personal mission for growth, and a bunch of other clich\u00e9 statements I never thought I\u2019d hear myself say. We just have to understand the game and work hard to get good at it. Let\u2019s look at each step to try to understand the challenges we\u2019re dealing with and how we can make progress: Step 1: Our Lives in the Fog Step 1 is the lowest step, the foggiest step, and unfortunately, for most of us it\u2019s our default level of existence. On Step 1, the fog is all up in our shit, thick and close and clogging our senses, leaving us going through life unconscious. Down here, the thoughts, values, and priorities of the Higher Being are completely lost in the blinding fog and the deafening roaring, tweeting, honking, howling, and squawking of the animals in our heads. This makes us 1) small-minded, 2) short-sighted, and 3) stupid. Let\u2019s discuss each of these: 1) On Step 1, you\u2019re terribly small-minded because the animals are running the show. When I look at the wide range of motivating emotions that humans experience, I don\u2019t see them as a scattered range, but rather falling into two distinct bins: the high-minded, love-based, advanced emotions of the Higher Being, and the small-minded, fear-based, primitive emotions of our brain animals. And on Step 1, we\u2019re completely intoxicated by the animal emotions as they roar at us through the dense fog. This is what makes us petty and jealous and what makes us so thoroughly enjoy the misfortune of others. It\u2019s what makes us scared, anxious, and insecure. It\u2019s why we\u2019re self-absorbed and narcissistic; vain and greedy; narrow-minded and judgmental; cold, callous, and even cruel. And only on Step 1 do we feel that primitive \u201cus versus them\u201d tribalism that makes us hate people different than us. You can find most of these same emotions in a clan of capuchin monkeys\u2014and that makes sense, because at their core, these emotions can be boiled down to the two keys of animal survival: self-preservation and the need to reproduce. Step 1 emotions are brutish and powerful and grab you by the collar, and when they\u2019re upon you, the Higher Being and his high-minded, love-based emotions are shoved into the sewer. 2) On Step 1, you\u2019re short-sighted, because the fog is six inches in front of your face, preventing you from seeing the big picture. The fog explains all kinds of totally illogical and embarrassingly short-sighted human behavior. Why else would anyone ever take a grandparent or parent for granted while they\u2019re around, seeing them only occasionally, opening up to them only rarely, and asking them barely any questions\u2014even though after they die, you can only think about how amazing they were and how you can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t relish the opportunity to enjoy your relationship with them and get to know them better when they were around? Why else would people brag so much , even though if they could see the big picture, it would be obvious that everyone finds out about the good things in your life eventually either way\u2014and that you always serve yourself way more by being modest? Why else would someone do the bare minimum at work, cut corners on work projects, and be dishonest about their efforts\u2014when anyone looking at the big picture would know that in a work environment, the truth about someone\u2019s work habits eventually becomes completely apparent to both bosses and colleagues, and you\u2019re never really fooling anyone? Why would someone insist on making sure everyone knows when they did something valuable for the company\u2014when it should be obvious that acting that way is transparent and makes it seem like you\u2019re working hard just for the credit, while just doing things well and having one of those things happen to be noticed does much more for your long term reputation and level of respect at the company? If not for thick fog, why would anyone ever pinch pennies over a restaurant bill or keep an unpleasantly-rigid scorecard of who paid for what on a trip, when everyone reading this could right now give each of their friends a quick and accurate 1-10 rating on the cheap-to-generous (or selfish-to-considerate) scale, and the few hundred bucks you save over time by being on the cheap end of the scale is hardly worth it considering how much more likable and respectable it is to be generous? What other explanation is there for the utterly inexplicable decision by so many famous men in positions of power to bring down the career and marriage they spent their lives building by having an affair? And why would anyone bend and loosen their integrity for tiny insignificant gains when integrity affects your long-term self-esteem and tiny insignificant gains affect nothing in the long term? How else could you explain the decision by so many people to let the fear of what others might think dictate the way they live, when if they could see clearly they\u2019d realize that A) that\u2019s a terrible reason to do or not do something, and B) no one\u2019s really thinking about you anyway\u2014they\u2019re buried in their own lives. And then there are all the times when someone\u2019s opaque blinders keep them in the wrong relationship , job, city, apartment, friendship, etc. for years, sometimes decades, only for them to finally make a change and say \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t do this earlier,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t see how wrong that was for me.\u201d They should absolutely believe it, because that\u2019s the power of the fog. 3) On Step 1, you\u2019re very, very stupid. One way this stupidity shows up is in us making the same obvious mistakes over and over and over again. 1 The most glaring example is the way the fog convinces us, time after time after time, that certain things will make us happy that in reality absolutely don\u2019t. The fog lines up a row of carrots, tells us that they\u2019re the key to happiness, and tells us to forget today\u2019s happiness in favor of directing all of our hope to all the happiness the future will hold because we\u2019re gonna get those carrots. And even though the fog has proven again and again that it has no idea how human happiness works\u2014even though we\u2019ve had so many experiences finally getting a carrot and feeling a ton of temporary happiness, only to watch that happiness fade right back down to our default level a few days later\u2014we continue to fall for the trick. It\u2019s like hiring a nutritionist to help you with your exhaustion, and they tell you that the key is to drink an espresso shot anytime you\u2019re tired. So you\u2019d try it and think the nutritionist was a genius until an hour later when it dropped you like an anvil back into exhaustion. You go back to the nutritionist, who gives you the same advice, so you try it again and the same thing happens. That would probably be it right? You\u2019d fire the nutritionist. Right? So why are we so gullible when it comes to the fog\u2019s advice on happiness and fulfillment? The fog is also much more harmful than the nutritionist because not only does it give us terrible advice\u2014 but the fog itself is the source of unhappiness . The only real solution to exhaustion is to sleep , and the only real way to improve happiness in a lasting way is to make progress in the battle against the fog. There\u2019s a concept in psychology called The Hedonic Treadmill, which suggests that humans have a stagnant default happiness level and when something good or bad happens, after an initial change in happiness, we always return to that default level. And on Step 1, this is completely true of course, given that trying to become permanently happier while in the fog is like trying to dry your body off while standing under the shower with the water running. But I refuse to believe the same species that builds skyscrapers, writes symphonies, flies to the moon, and understands what a Higgs boson is is incapable of getting off the treadmill and actually improving in a meaningful way. I think the way to do it is by learning to climb this consciousness staircase to spend more of our time on Steps 2, 3, and 4, and less of it mired unconsciously in the fog. Step 2: Thinning the Fog to Reveal Context Humans can do something amazing that no other creature on Earth can do\u2014they can imagine . If you show an animal a tree, they see a tree. Only a human can imagine the acorn that sunk into the ground 40 years earlier, the small flimsy stalk it was at three years old, how stark the tree must look when it\u2019s winter, and the eventual dead tree lying horizontally in that same place. This is the magic of the Higher Being in our heads. On the other hand, the animals in your head, like their real world relatives, can only see a tree, and when they see one, they react instantly to it based on their primitive needs. When you\u2019re on Step 1, your unconscious animal-run state doesn\u2019t even remember that the Higher Being exists, and his genius abilities go to waste. Step 2 is all about thinning out the fog enough to bring the Higher Being\u2019s thoughts and abilities into your consciousness, allowing you to see behind and around the things that happen in life. Step 2 is about bringing context into your awareness, which reveals a far deeper and more nuanced version of the truth. There are plenty of activities or undertakings that can help thin out your fog. To name three: 1) Learning more about the world through education, travel, and life experience\u2014as your perspective broadens, you can see a clearer and more accurate version of the truth. 2) Active reflection. This is what a journal can help with, or therapy, which is basically examining your own brain with the help of a fog expert. Sometimes a hypothetical question can be used as \u201cfog goggles,\u201d allowing you to see something clearly through the fog\u2014questions like, \u201cWhat would I do if money were no object?\u201d or \u201cHow would I advise someone else on this?\u201d or \u201cWill I regret not having done this when I\u2019m 80?\u201d These questions are a way to ask your Higher Being\u2019s opinion on something without the animals realizing what\u2019s going on, so they\u2019ll stay calm and the Higher Being can actually talk\u2014like when parents spell out a word in front of their four-year-old when they don\u2019t want him to know what they\u2019re saying. 2 3) Meditation, exercise, yoga, etc.\u2014activities that help quiet the brain\u2019s unconscious chatter, i.e. allowing the fog to settle. But the easiest and most effective way to thin out the fog is simply to be aware of it. By knowing that fog exists, understanding what it is and the different forms it takes, and learning to recognize when you\u2019re in it, you hinder its ability to run your life. You can\u2019t get to Step 2 if you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re on Step 1. The way to move onto Step 2 is by remembering to stay aware of the context behind and around what you see, what you come across, and the decisions you make. That\u2019s it\u2014remaining cognizant of the fog and remembering to look at the whole context keeps you conscious, aware of reality, and as you\u2019ll see, makes you a much better version of yourself than you are on Step 1. Some examples\u2014 Here\u2019s what a rude cashier looks like on Step 1 vs. Step 2: Here\u2019s what gratitude looks like: Something good happening: Something bad happening: That phenomenon where everything suddenly seems horrible late at night in bed: A flat tire: Long-term consequences: Looking at context makes us aware how much we actually know about most situations (as well as what we don\u2019t know, like what the cashier\u2019s day was like so far), and it reminds us of the complexity and nuance of people, life, and situations. When we\u2019re on Step 2, this broader scope and increased clarity makes us feel calmer and less fearful of things that aren\u2019t actually scary, and the animals\u2014who gain their strength from fear and thrive off of unconsciousness\u2014suddenly just look kind of ridiculous: When the small-minded animal emotions are less in our face, the more advanced emotions of the Higher Being\u2014love, compassion, humility, empathy, etc.\u2014begin to light up. The good news is there\u2019s no learning required to be on Step 2\u2014your Higher Being already knows the context around all of these life situations. It doesn\u2019t take hard work, and no additional information or expertise is needed\u2014you only have to consciously think about being on Step 2 instead of Step 1 and you\u2019re there. You\u2019re probably there right now just by reading this. The bad news is that it\u2019s extremely hard to stay on Step 2 for long. The Catch-22 here is that it\u2019s not easy to stay conscious of the fog because the fog makes you unconscious. That\u2019s the first challenge at hand. You can\u2019t get rid of the fog, and you can\u2019t always keep it thin, but you can get better at noticing when it\u2019s thick and develop effective strategies for thinning it out whenever you consciously focus on it. If you\u2019re evolving successfully, as you get older, you should be spending more and more time on Step 2 and less and less on Step 1. Step 3: Shocking Reality I . . . a universe of atoms . . . an atom in the universe. \u2014 Richard Feynman _________ Step 3 is when things start to get weird. Even on the more enlightened Step 2, we kind of think we\u2019re here: As delightful as that is, it\u2019s a complete delusion. We live our days as if we\u2019re just here on this green and brown land with our blue sky and our chipmunks and our caterpillars. But this is actually what\u2019s happening: But even more actually, this is happening: We also tend to kind of think this is the situation: When really, it\u2019s this: You might even think you\u2019re a thing. Do you? No you\u2019re a ton of these: This is the next iteration of truth on our little staircase, and our brains can\u2019t really handle it. Asking a human to internalize the vastness of space or the eternity of time or the tininess of atoms is like asking a dog to stand up on its hind legs\u2014you can do it if you focus, but it\u2019s a strain and you can\u2019t hold it for very long. 3 You can think about the facts anytime\u2014The Big Bang was 13.8 billion years ago, which is about 130,000 times longer than humans have existed; if the sun were a ping pong ball in New York, the closest star to us would be a ping pong ball in Atlanta; the Milky Way is so big that if you made a scale model of it that was the size of the US, you would still need a microscope to see the sun; atoms are so small that there are about as many atoms in one grain of salt as there are grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. But once in a while, when you deeply reflect on one of these facts, or when you\u2019re in the right late night conversation with the right person, or when you\u2019re staring at the stars, or when you think too hard about what death actually means\u2014you have a Whoa moment. A true Whoa moment is hard to come by and even harder to maintain for very long, like our dog\u2019s standing difficulties. Thinking about this level of reality is like looking at an amazing photo of the Grand Canyon; a Whoa moment is like being at the Grand Canyon\u2014the two experiences are similar but somehow vastly different. Facts can be fascinating, but only in a Whoa moment does your brain actually wrap itself around true reality. In a Whoa moment, your brain for a second transcends what it\u2019s been built to do and offers you a brief glimpse into the astonishing truth of our existence. And a Whoa moment is how you get to Step 3. I love Whoa moments. They make me feel some intense combination of awe, elation, sadness, and wonder. More than anything, they make me feel ridiculously, profoundly humble\u2014and that level of humility does weird things to a person. In those moments, all those words religious people use\u2014awe, worship, miracle, eternal connection\u2014make perfect sense. I want to get on my knees and surrender. This is when I feel spiritual. And in those fleeting moments, there is no fog\u2014my Higher Being is in full flow and can see everything in perfect clarity. The normally-complicated world of morality is suddenly crystal clear, because the only fathomable emotions on Step 3 are the most high-level. Any form of pettiness or hatred is a laughable concept up on Step 3\u2014with no fog to obscure things, the animals are completely naked, exposed for the sad little creatures that they are. On Step 1, I snap back at the rude cashier, who had the nerve to be a dick to me . On Step 2, the rudeness doesn\u2019t faze me because I know it\u2019s about him, not me, and that I have no idea what his day or life has been like. On Step 3, I see myself as a miraculous arrangement of atoms in vast space that for a split second in endless eternity has come together to form a moment of consciousness that is my life\u2026and I see that cashier as another moment of consciousness that happens to exist on the same speck of time and space that I do. And the only possible emotion I could have for him on Step 3 is love. In a Whoa moment\u2019s transcendent level of consciousness, I see every interaction, every motivation, every news headline in unusual clarity\u2014and difficult life decisions are much more obvious. I feel wise . Of course, if this were my normal state, I\u2019d be teaching monks somewhere on a mountain in Myanmar, and I\u2019m not teaching any monks anywhere because it\u2019s not my normal state. Whoa moments are rare and very soon after one, I\u2019m back down here being a human again. But the emotions and the clarity of Step 3 are so powerful, that even after you topple off the step, some of it sticks around. Each time you humiliate the animals, a little bit of their future power over you is diminished. And that\u2019s why Step 3 is so important\u2014even though no one that I know can live permanently on Step 3, regular visits help you dramatically in the ongoing Step 1 vs Step 2 battle, which makes you a better and happier person. Step 3 is also the answer to anyone who accuses atheists of being amoral or cynical or nihilistic, or wonders how atheists find any meaning in life without the hope and incentive of an afterlife. That\u2019s a Step 1 way to view an atheist, where life on Earth is taken for granted and it\u2019s assumed that any positive impulse or emotion must be due to circumstances outside of life. On Step 3, I feel immensely lucky to be alive and can\u2019t believe how cool it is that I\u2019m a group of atoms that can think about atoms\u2014on Step 3, life itself is more than enough to make me excited, hopeful, loving, and kind. But Step 3 is only possible because science has cleared the way there, which is why Carl Sagan said that \u201cscience is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.\u201d In this way, science is the \u201cprophet\u201d of this framework\u2014the one who reveals new truth to us and gives us an opportunity to alter ourselves by accessing it. So to recap so far\u2014on Step 1, you\u2019re in a delusional bubble that Step 2 pops. On Step 2, there\u2019s much more clarity about life, but it\u2019s within a much bigger delusional bubble, one that Step 3 pops. But Step 3 is supposed to be total, fog-free clarity on truth\u2014so how could there be another step? Step 4: The Great Unknown If we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed. \u2014 Carl Sagan _________ The game so far has for the most part been clearing out fog to become as conscious as possible of what we as people and as a species know about truth: On Step 4, we\u2019re reminded of the complete truth\u2014which is this: The fact is, any discussion of our full reality\u2014of the truth of the universe or our existence\u2014is a complete delusion without acknowledging that big purple blob that makes up almost all of that reality. But you know humans\u2014they don\u2019t like that purple blob one bit. Never have. The blob frightens and humiliates humans, and we have a rich history of denying its existence entirely, which is like living on the beach and pretending the ocean isn\u2019t there. Instead, we just stamp our foot and claim that now we\u2019ve finally figured it all out. On the religious side, we invent myths and proclaim them as truth\u2014and even a devout religious believer reading this who stands by the truth of their particular book would agree with me about the fabrication of the other few thousand books out there. On the science front, we\u2019ve managed to be consistently gullible in believing that \u201crealizing you\u2019ve been horribly wrong about reality\u201d is a phenomenon only of the past. Having our understanding of reality overturned by a new groundbreaking discovery is like a shocking twist in this epic mystery novel humanity is reading, and scientific progress is regularly dotted with these twists\u2014the Earth being round, the solar system being heliocentric, not geocentric, the discovery of subatomic particles or galaxies other than our own, and evolutionary theory, to name a few. So how is it possible, with the knowledge of all those breakthroughs, that Lord Kelvin, one of history\u2019s greatest scientists, said in the year 1900, \u201cThere is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement\u201d 4 \u2014i.e. this time, all the twists actually are finished. Of course, Kelvin was as wrong as every other arrogant scientist in history\u2014the theory of general relativity and then the theory of quantum mechanics would both topple science on its face over the next century. Even if we acknowledge today that there will be more twists in the future, we\u2019re probably kind of inclined to think we\u2019ve figured out most of the major things and have a far closer-to-complete picture of reality than the people who thought the Earth was flat. Which, to me, sounds like this: The fact is, let\u2019s remember that we don\u2019t know what the universe is . Is it everything? Is it one tiny bubble in a multiverse frothing with bubbles? Is it not a bubble at all but an optical illusion hologram ? And we know about the Big Bang, but was that the beginning of everything? Did something arise from nothing , or was it just the latest in a long series of expansion/collapse cycles? 5 We have no clue what dark matter is, only that there\u2019s a shit-ton of it in the universe, and when we discussed The Fermi Paradox , it became entirely clear that science has no idea about whether there\u2019s other life out there or how advanced it might be. How about String Theory, which claims to be the secret to unifying the two grand but seemingly-unrelated theories of the physical world, general relativity and quantum mechanics? It\u2019s either the grandest theory we\u2019ve ever come up with or totally false, and there are great scientists on both sides of this debate. And as laypeople, all we need to do is take a look at those two well-accepted theories to realize how vastly different reality can be from how it seems: like general relativity telling us that if you flew to a black hole and circled around it a few times in intense gravity and then returned to Earth a few hours after you left, decades would have passed on Earth while you were gone. And that\u2019s like an ice cream cone compared to the insane shit quantum mechanics tells us\u2014like two particles across the universe from one another being mysteriously linked to each other\u2019s behavior , or a cat that\u2019s both alive and dead at the same time, until you look at it. And the thing is, everything I just mentioned is still within the realm of our understanding. As we established earlier, compared to a more evolved level of consciousness, we might be like a three-year-old, a monkey, or an ant\u2014so why would we assume that we\u2019re even capable of understanding everything in that purple blob? A monkey can\u2019t understand that the Earth is a round planet, let alone that the solar system, galaxy, or universe exists. You could try to explain it to a monkey for years and it wouldn\u2019t be possible. So what are we completely incapable of grasping even if a more intelligent species tried its hardest to explain it to us? Probably almost everything. There are really two options when thinking about the big, big picture: be humble or be absurd. The nonsensical thing about humans feigning certainty because we\u2019re scared is that in the old days, when it seemed on the surface that we were the center of all creation, uncertainty was frightening because it made our reality seem so much bleaker than we had thought\u2014but now, with so much more uncovered, things look highly bleak for us as people and as a species, so our fear should welcome uncertainty. Given my default outlook that I have a small handful of decades left and then an eternity of nonexistence, the fact that we might be totally wrong sounds tremendously hopeful to me. Ironically, when my thinking reaches the top of this rooted-in-atheism staircase, the notion that something that seems divine to us might exist doesn\u2019t seem so ridiculous anymore. I\u2019m still totally atheist when it comes to all human-created conceptions of a divine higher force\u2014which all, in my opinion, proclaim far too much certainty. But could a super-advanced force exist? It seems more than likely. Could we have been created by something/someone bigger than us or be living as part of a simulation without realizing it? Sure\u2014I\u2019m a three-year-old, remember, so who am I to say no? To me, complete rational logic tells me to be atheist about all of the Earth\u2019s religions and utterly agnostic about the nature of our existence or the possible existence of a higher being. I don\u2019t arrive there via any form of faith, just by logic. I find Step 4 mentally mind-blowing but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ever quite able to access it in a spiritual way like I sometimes can with Step 3\u2014Step 4 Whoa moments might be reserved for Einstein-level thinkers\u2014but even if I can\u2019t get my feet up on Step 4, I can know it\u2019s there, what it means, and I can remind myself of its existence. So what does that do for me as a human? Well remember that powerful humility I mentioned in Step 3? It multiplies that by 100. For reasons I just discussed, it makes me feel more hopeful. And it leaves me feeling pleasantly resigned to the fact that I will never understand what\u2019s going on, which makes me feel like I can take my hand off the wheel, sit back, relax, and just enjoy the ride. In this way, I think Step 4 can make us live more in the present\u2014if I\u2019m just a molecule floating around an ocean I can\u2019t understand, I might as well just enjoy it. The way Step 4 can serve humanity is by helping to crush the notion of certainty. Certainty is primitive, leads to \u201cus versus them\u201d tribalism, and starts wars. We should be united in our uncertainty, not divided over fabricated certainty. And the more humans turn around and look at that big purple blob, the better off we\u2019ll be. Why Wisdom is the Goal Nothing clears fog like a deathbed, which is why it\u2019s then that people can always see with more clarity what they should have done differently\u2014I wish I had spent less time working; I wish I had communicated with my wife more; I wish I had traveled more; etc. The goal of personal growth should be to gain that deathbed clarity while your life is still happening so you can actually do something about it. The way you do that is by developing as much wisdom as possible, as early as possible. To me, wisdom is the most important thing to work towards as a human. It\u2019s the big objective\u2014the umbrella goal under which all other goals fall into place. I believe I have one and only one chance to live, and I want to do it in the most fulfilled and meaningful way possible\u2014that\u2019s the best outcome for me, and I do a lot more good for the world that way. Wisdom gives people the insight to know what \u201cfulfilled and meaningful\u201d actually means and the courage to make the choices that will get them there. And while life experience can contribute to wisdom, I think wisdom is mostly already in all of our heads\u2014it\u2019s everything the Higher Being knows. When we\u2019re not wise, it\u2019s because we don\u2019t have access to the Higher Being\u2019s wisdom because it\u2019s buried in fog. The fog is anti-wisdom, and when you move up the staircase into a clearer place, wisdom is simply a by-product of that increased consciousness. One thing I learned at some point is that growing old or growing tall is not the same as growing up . Being a grownup is about your level of wisdom and the size of your mind\u2019s scope\u2014and it turns out that it doesn\u2019t especially correlate with age. After a certain age, growing up is about overcoming your fog, and that\u2019s about the person, not the age. I know some supremely wise older people, but there are also a lot of people my age who seem much wiser than their parents about a lot of things. Someone on a growth path whose fog thins as they age will become wiser with age, but I find the reverse happens with people who don\u2019t actively grow\u2014the fog hardens around them and they actually become even less conscious, and even more certain about everything, with age. When I think about people I know, I realize that my level of respect and admiration for a person is almost entirely in line with how wise and conscious a person I think they are. The people I hold in the highest regard are the grownups in my life\u2014and their ages completely vary. Another Look at Religion in Light of this Framework: This discussion helps clarify my issues with traditional organized religion. There are plenty of good people, good ideas, good values, and good wisdom in the religious world, but to me that seems like something happening in spite of religion and not because of it. Using religion for growth requires an innovative take on things, since at a fundamental level, most religions seem to treat people like children instead of pushing them to grow. Many of today\u2019s religions play to people\u2019s fog with \u201cbelieve in this or else\u2026\u201d fear-mongering and books that are often a rallying cry for \u2018us vs. them\u2019 divisiveness. They tell people to look to ancient scripture for answers instead of the depths of the mind, and their stubborn certainty when it comes to right and wrong often leaves them at the back of the pack when it comes to the evolution of social issues. Their certainty when it comes to history ends up actively pushing their followers away from truth\u2014as evidenced by the 42% of Americans who have been deprived of knowing the truth about evolution. (An even worse staircase criminal is the loathsome world of American politics, with a culture that lives on Step 1 and where politicians appeal directly to people\u2019s animals, deliberately avoiding anything on Steps 2-4.) So What Am I? Yes, I\u2019m an atheist, but atheism isn\u2019t a growth model any more than \u201cI don\u2019t like rollerblading\u201d is a workout strategy. So I\u2019m making up a term for what I am\u2014I\u2019m a Truthist. In my framework, truth is what I\u2019m always looking for, truth is what I worship, and learning to see truth more easily and more often is what leads to growth. In Truthism, the goal is to grow wiser over time, and wisdom falls into your lap whenever you\u2019re conscious enough to see the truth about people, situations, the world, or the universe. The fog is what stands in your way, making you unconscious, delusional, and small-minded, so the key day-to-day growth strategy is staying cognizant of the fog and training your mind to try to see the full truth in any situation. Over time, you want your [Time on Step 2] / [Time on Step 1] ratio to go up a little bit each year, and you want to get better and better at inducing Step 3 Whoa moments and reminding yourself of the Step 4 purple blob. If you do those things, I think you\u2019re evolving in the best possible way, and it will have profound effects on all aspects of your life. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s Truthism. Am I a good Truthist? I\u2019m okay. Better than I used to be with a long way to go. But defining this framework will help\u2014I\u2019ll know where to put my focus, what to be wary of, and how to evaluate my progress, which will help me make sure I\u2019m actually improving and lead to quicker growth. To help keep me on mission, I made a Truthism logo: That\u2019s my symbol, my mantra, my WWJD\u2014it\u2019s the thing I can look at when something good or bad happens, when a big decision is at hand, or on a normal day as a reminder to stay aware of the fog and keep my eye on the big picture. And What Are You? My challenge to you is to decide on a term for yourself that accurately sums up your growth framework. If Christianity is your thing and it\u2019s genuinely helping you grow, that word can be Christian. Maybe you already have your own clear, well-defined advancement strategy and you just need a name for it. Maybe Truthism hit home for you, resembles the way you already think, and you want to try being a Truthist with me. Or maybe you have no idea what your growth framework is, or what you\u2019re using isn\u2019t working. If either A) you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve evolved in a meaningful way in the past couple years, or B) you aren\u2019t able to corroborate your values and philosophies with actual reasoning that matters to you, then you need to find a new framework. To do this, just ask yourself the same questions I asked myself: What\u2019s the goal that you want to evolve towards (and why is that the goal), what does the path look like that gets you there, what\u2019s in your way, and how do you overcome those obstacles? What are your practices on a day-to-day level, and what should your progress look like year-to-year? Most importantly, how do you stay strong and maintain the practice for years and years, not four days? After you\u2019ve thought that through, name the framework and make a symbol or mantra. (Then share your strategy in the comments or email me about it, because articulating it helps clarify it in your head, and because it\u2019s useful and interesting for others to hear about your framework.) I hope I\u2019ve convinced you how important this is. Don\u2019t wait until your deathbed to figure out what life is all about. ___________ To print this post or read it offline, try the PDF .

Unrelatedly, after finishing my outline for this post, I estimated that the writing part would take me 10 hours\u2014which is odd, because I\u2019m about eight hours in now and still on Step 1 of the staircase. You\u2019d think that after writing about 50 posts in the past year and underestimating how long each of them would take, I might not have been so dramatically delusional by this point. You\u2019d think. If you were to continue thinking, you might also assume that yesterday, when I needed to go from 116th Street in Manhattan to the World Trade Center for an event I absolutely could not be late for, I\u2019d have considered the fact that I know from experience that this usually takes an hour before leaving for the event only 40 minutes ahead of time. We agree that that\u2019s what you\u2019d think. So why was I sprinting at the end to make it there on time? Why would I end up sweating to make it somewhere on time\u2014 for the nine trillionth time in my life\u2014 when this grossly undignified and unpleasant experience is so easily avoidable? Because when I make these inexplicably stupid, self-defeating decisions, I\u2019m swimming in fog. \u21a9 I use a weird one, where I pretend I have a dial I can set to a number of sleep hours and then press the button and instantly it\u2019s that many hours later and I\u2019ve slept the number of hours on the dial, and I can resume doing what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m a night owl, but if I had that dial, I\u2019d go to bed around 11pm and sleep eight hours almost every night of the year. This isolates for me the fact that I\u2019m not actually a night owl\u2014my Higher Being wants to sleep from 11-7\u2014it\u2019s just that I have a short-sighted, fog-based resistance against going to sleep. Which probably annoyingly boils down to fear of death somehow. \u21a9 Sidenote: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQr8UWuVefA \u21a9 Some dispute that Kelvin said this, claiming it was actually said by another great 19th century physicist, Albert A.

Obama was president, the Cavs were on their way to beating the Warriors in the NBA finals, Game of Thrones was still good, and I was 34 years old with my whole life ahead of me. Wait But Why had been around for three years, a stretch during which I wrote about 100 blog posts on dozens of topics. On the afternoon of June 18, 2016, I was sitting on the couch engaging in a familiar ritual: looking through my list of future post ideas, trying to pick my next topic. And then I had a thought. So many of the post ideas I was scanning through were about the future. Virtual reality. Artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering. Life extension. Multiplanetary expansion. But lately, it felt like there was a cloud hanging over all these topics. My urge to write about the future comes from an excited optimism that\u2019s fundamental to my personality. I believe at a deep level that the future is going to be an amazing, exhilarating ride, and nothing is more fun than learning about cutting edge developments that can offer clues into what magic might lie down the road. But on June 18, 2016, I didn\u2019t feel excitedly optimistic. There was a different feel to the world than there had been in my previous blogging years. Something seemed off about the society around me, like there had been a subtle, foreboding shift in the balance between reason and madness. It felt like we were losing our grip on something important. The fun thing about being a blogger is you can write about whatever the fuck you want. And a good compass for me had always been that if something was incessantly on my mind, it was probably a good post topic. So I decided to write what I call a \u201cmini post.\u201d Wait But Why articles are long, and they go deep. I bathe in the topic for a little while, dread writing it for a little while, then finally pump it out, draw the drawings, give it a read, and post. A mini-post is much chiller\u2014I just open WordPress and type what\u2019s on my mind, and post it. So I opened WordPress to write a little post about that cloud I felt hovering over my other post topics. I\u2019d knock out a draft tonight, give it a read tomorrow, and publish it. But nothing came out. I didn\u2019t know where to start. There were a bunch of bad trends: Tribalism was flaring up everywhere, mass shaming campaigns were roaring back into fashion, politicians were increasingly clown-like, public discourse had become a battle of one-dimensional narratives. But why was all of this happening now? Was the problem related to social media? To politics or current events? Was it some broader cultural or psychological phenomenon? I also noticed that I wasn\u2019t feeling the normal confidence I felt when I started a new post. Something about this topic felt scary . I never felt scared to write about anything before. This fear of writing about this topic seemed like it was an important part of the topic. Nope. Not a mini-post. I needed the full week for this one. But a funny thing happened that week. I didn\u2019t write anything. Instead, I started jotting down notes and ideas in a Text Edit document called \u201csociety\u201d that quickly became long and messy. I abandoned that document and opened up \u201csociety 2\u201d to give myself a fresh start. Soon there was a Society folder with seven note documents. I could have just stopped there. Too big a topic, too out of my wheelhouse, too icky, too scary. An outline for a virtual reality post was sitting right there in my Future Posts folder waiting for me. But I\u2019m really, really bad with the sunk cost fallacy. I had already put so much time and thought in, and I couldn\u2019t handle all of it being for nothing. And so began the next six years of my life. I wish I could say that I actively decided to put everything else aside and write a giant opus on the problems with my society. But it didn\u2019t happen like that. If you asked me at any point over the past six years when I was gonna be done with my society post\u2014and plenty of people did\u2014the answer was always, \u201cI\u2019m finally getting close.\u201d And I believed it every time. I fully believed, every time, that this thing was almost done. The delusion of a madman. And the problem with this particular delusion is that it\u2019s a perfect way to ruin your life. If I believed I was working on a six-year project, I\u2019d have worked the project into my normal life. I\u2019d get into a rhythm that would allow for a work-life balance. But when you think you\u2019re at most a couple months from finishing a big project, it makes sense to put everything else on hold for just a little bit more until the project is done. I wasn\u2019t someone who never made fun plans or who worked on every vacation or who took a lot of Vyvanse\u2014I was someone who did those things just for right now, because I\u2019m in crunch time on a big project. For six years. In May of 2017, I asked my girlfriend to marry me. We had been dating since 2011. She had seen the whole Wait But Why journey up close and had now been living with \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this big project\u201d Tim for a year. We set our wedding date for October of 2018. Thank god by then I\u2019d be out of this pit and working on all kinds of other fun projects. But instead of the project wrapping up, it just got bigger. The topic had led me down dozens of totally different rabbit holes, and everything I read seemed relevant to it. I don\u2019t like telling a partial story. Like I had in other posts, I was determined to tell the full, full story. If I noticed something in my reading or on social media or in the news that seemed like an important piece of the puzzle, it had to be incorporated. If that fucked up the current outline, then the outline would have to adapt. The problem is that the outlines became ridiculous. I couldn\u2019t keep it all in my head at once, so I made sub-outlines, and sub-sub-outlines. The Society folder now looked like this: As 2017 became 2018, I decided that the wedding would be the hard deadline that I needed. My girlfriend had spent way too much time with an \u201cI\u2019m almost done with this massive post on society\u201d boyfriend. She would have a much more pleasant husband. I\u2019m still not sure how I turned into a crazy person. The way to proceed was obvious. I should pick a piece of this albatross, throw the rest away, and focus in on it. Do what I had done for years\u2014suck it up, get serious, knock something out, and move on with my life. But I\u2019m a nightmare of a perfectionist and knew that the ultimate prize was to figure out how to not focus in but capture it all in a single, overarching story. It all was one big story, and I wanted to tell it. Wedding day came and went. People in my life were worried about me. They tried encouraging me, shaming me, setting deadlines for me, reminding me that one post really shouldn\u2019t take multiple years. Nothing seemed to help. Finally, in mid-2019, I hatched a plan that would once and for all end this thing. Rather than post a gargantuan blog post, I\u2019d make it a series . This would break it into parts, which is less daunting. Plus, I had learned that the adrenaline of knowing that my readers were only days away from seeing what I was working on was a huge motivator that I had been sorely missing. I called it The Story of Us and in August of 2019, the first chapter went up. The whole thing would be 12 chapters, I decided, and even though the chapters got longer as they went, and the time between them expanded, it was finally happening\u2014I was publishing the damn thing. The end was near. Then came Chapter 11. The first 10 chapters had introduced the core framework of the series and talked broadly about the big picture of what I thought our problem was. In Chapter 11, I was going to dip into more controversial territory, looking at the past few years of news stories through the lens of the framework we had developed. It turns out I had a lot more to say about what was going on around me than I had anticipated. Soon, my draft of Chapter 11 was longer than the first ten chapters combined. I have problems. Now it was the middle of 2020. Covid was in full swing. Thousands of people were marching by my apartment in protest. It was a seismic year for American society. Everything I was writing about was happening, and rapidly evolving, literally outside my window. What I had written months earlier suddenly seemed stale. Also, Chapter 11 was over 100,000 words. Death. It started to dawn on me that I really needed to just turn this into a book. Between the mountains of feedback I had gotten from readers and friends on The Story of Us and the mountains of new thoughts I had about all the recent developments in the world, I knew that there was one way to really bring the project from hell home: open a blank Microsoft Word document and write a newer, better, complete story, and do it in a book format that people could read more easily than a web page. Somewhere, a fairy died. So I started writing the book. I\u2019d call it the name it should have always been called: What\u2019s Our Problem? I knew what I wanted to say. I just had to write it. I finished V1 in December of 2021 and triumphantly tweeted about it. Done! In a sense! It was 250,000 words, which is about 150,000 words too long. And missing most of the drawings. And I had a giant \u201cADD IN\u201d document full of news stories which had happened in the year and a half since I started writing the book that would need to be incorporated. It\u2019s hard to cut writing. Perfectionism, sunk costs, etc. Procrastination abound. I would try to cut a section down, polish it off, and move on, but kept finding myself rewriting the section entirely. I was moving at a snail\u2019s pace. Then one day in June of 2022, my wife woke me up by handing me a positive pregnancy stick. It was a surreal, joyful moment. I\u2019ve never been anyone\u2019s dad before but always wanted to be. Then the thought hit me. NOPE. 100% no. It could not happen. This baby could not enter a world where this project was still going on. Suddenly, an old friend entered the room. The baby was due on March 7, 2023, so this book would be completely done by mid-February, period end of story. V2 got finished (July 2022). Then V3 (September). Then V4 (December). Editors and fact-checkers and copy editors and ebook designers and audiobook engineers were hired. Alicia (Wait But Why\u2019s Manager of Lots of Things, who had already put in thousands of hours helping with every element of the process), went into crazy crunch time mode. I sat in a booth for 45 hours reading the audiobook (January). The ebook was designed (February). The launch date was set. It took 2,440 days, but my mini-post on society is done and coming out on Tuesday. Fuckin shit. Here are the pages: Some stats: 121,000 words 303 drawings 11,081 documents in my Society folder I\u2019m 41 A condensed and re-written Story of Us makes up 25% of the book. The rest is all new. This book is my best crack at explaining what I think is an existential risk to liberal societies and what I think we need to do to get to that awesome future I used to be so excited about. There are dozens of concepts in the book that serve as a kind of toolbox for understanding our societies, our group dynamics, and our own minds. I\u2019m very proud of the final product and never want to have an experience like this again. If you would like to take my last six years and put it into your brain, here are the different options (all available on Tuesday Feb 21): Ebook: Available on most major platforms (you can also buy the EPUB directly). It looks best on color e-readers and tablets (especially on vertical scroll mode), but also fine on phones and black-and-white e-readers. The best ebook experience we\u2019ve seen is Apple Books > iPad > sepia > vertical scroll. Available for preorder on Apple and Kindle \u2013 the rest are available on launch day, Feb 21. Wait But Why: Without the limitations of the other formats, this is where the drawings can be displayed full-size, where footnotes can be interactive, etc. The downside here is that you can only read it on a tablet or phone, not an e-reader, and there\u2019s no dark mode at the moment. Available here . Click here to see how the book looks in different formats Audiobook: Available on most major platforms (or you can buy the mp3 directly). Read painstakingly by me. I personally do most of my reading via audiobook, so I tried to make it the best possible experience. The obvious downside is that the book has 300+ visuals, so we made a webpage (and pdf) for audiobook listeners with the 46 most important drawings, numbered. When I get to that point in the reading, I say something like, \u201cGo look at drawing number 24.\u201d Available for preorder on Kobo and on other platforms (Audible, Apple, Spotify, and more) on launch day. If you can\u2019t afford it: I really want everyone who wants to read this book to be able to do so, so if you can\u2019t afford to buy the book, email us at [email\u00a0protected] and we\u2019ll give you a code that lets you read it on WBW for free. Print: There is not a print version, which I know will disappoint some people. There are a few reasons for this, but the biggest one is that printing this big full-color book would have delayed launch by many, many months, and fuck that. UPDATE (2024): The book is now available in print! The physical book is a very big, nice, pretty object, and the drawings look great. Available on Amazon , Barnes & Noble , and Bookshop . Also, Idea Labs: A major theme in this book is how we can do better at having productive discussions about tough topics. So we\u2019re planning to create virtual book clubs for anyone who is interested in discussing the book with other WBW readers. More on this soon, but if you\u2019re interested in being part of a book club, enter your email address here . So that\u2019s the story with this book. Can\u2019t wait to hear your thoughts. If you want to be notified on launch day and keep up with whatever else we work on in the future, make sure you\u2019re on our email list . ___________ Another time I did something hard: Doing a TED Talk: The Full Story The number of years this book took me: From 1,000,000 to Graham\u2019s Number If the news is making you scared about A) UFOs or B) AI If you\u2019d like to support Wait But Why, here\u2019s our Patreon.

Quick note before we jump in: This is a post about something I\u2019ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are\u2014which is weird because I\u2019m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it\u2019s super clear he has very little idea what he\u2019s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do. This post isn\u2019t me giving you career advice really\u2014it\u2019s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You\u2019re not a pro at this, but you\u2019re certainly more qualified to figure out what\u2019s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren\u2019t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren\u2019t sure you\u2019re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity. Finally, it feels very good to put this post up. It\u2019s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why\u2014a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I\u2019m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period. \u2013 Tim PDF: If you want to print this post or read it offline, the PDF is probably the way to go. You can buy it here . _______ Your Life Path So Far For most of us, childhood is kind of like a river, and we\u2019re kind of like tadpoles. We didn\u2019t choose the river. We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We\u2019re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn\u2019t to think about our path\u2014it\u2019s to succeed on the path we\u2019ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us. For many of us\u2014and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers\u2014our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college. 1 We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren\u2019t really that different from one another. In the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond\u2019s shores\u2014out there where the real world starts and where we\u2019ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings. And then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we\u2019re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives. There are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you\u2019re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less: But before you can even address your general uselessness, there\u2019s an even bigger issue\u2014your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path\u2014except you. And you\u2019ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you\u2019ve only been in charge of the micro decisions\u2014\u201dHow do I succeed at my job as a student?\u201d\u2014and now you\u2019re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like \u201cWho am I?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the important things in life?\u201d and \u201cWhat are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?\u201d When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we\u2019ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this. Then time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life\u2019s story. At the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life\u2019s path in its entirety, from an aerial view. When scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren\u2019t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don\u2019t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn\u2019t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in. So this is a post about path-making. Let\u2019s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we\u2019re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense. The Cook and the Chef\u2014Revisited In the past, I\u2019ve written about the critical distinction between \u201creasoning from first principles\u201d and \u201creasoning by analogy\u201d\u2014or what I called being a \u201cchef\u201d vs. being a \u201ccook.\u201d Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I\u2019ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life. The idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning\u2014reasoning by analogy\u2014happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there\u2014kind of like a cook following an already written recipe. A pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity. Being a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy\u2014which makes sense, because you\u2019re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you\u2019re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I\u2019m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I\u2019m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I\u2019ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I\u2019ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense\u2014because clothes aren\u2019t important to me, and they\u2019re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook. 2 But then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important\u2014like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities. Career-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let\u2019s spell out the obvious reasons why: Time. For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you\u2019ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you\u2019re left with 250,000 \u201cmeaningful adult hours.\u201d 3 So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time\u2014not something to be a cook about. Quality of Life. Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you\u2019re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying. Impact. On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can\u2019t test this, but I\u2019m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future\u2014but the kind of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it. Identity. In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to be when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we are. We don\u2019t say, \u201cI practice law\u201d\u2014we say, \u201cI am a lawyer.\u201d This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person\u2019s career quadruples as the person\u2019s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing. So yeah\u2014your career path isn\u2019t like my shitty sweatshirt. It\u2019s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in \u201cDefinitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it\u201d territory. Your Career Map Which brings us to you. I don\u2019t know exactly what your deal is. But there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re somewhere in one of the blue regions\u2014 \u2014which means your career path is a work in progress. 4 Whether you\u2019re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a \u201cCareer Plans\u201d map. We can group map holders into three broad categories\u2014each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life. One group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark. These are people who feel indecisive about their career path. They\u2019ve been told to follow their passion, but they don\u2019t feel especially passionate about anything. They\u2019ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they\u2019ve changed and they\u2019re no longer sure who they are or where they\u2019re going. Other people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right\u2014but find their legs walking in a different direction. They\u2019re living with one of the most common sources of human misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong. The lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they\u2019re marching in that direction. But even these people should pause and ask themselves, \u201cWho actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?\u201d The answer can get confusing. I\u2019m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection. The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box Extremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, \u201cAm I qualified to write about this?\u201d Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic: 1) I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path. 2) My path has taken a lot of turns\u2014from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy. 3) After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That\u2019s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong. 4) On top of having my own story to look at, I\u2019ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I\u2019ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal. 5) Finally, this isn\u2019t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful\u2014there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I\u2019m not one of them. It\u2019s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too. Now that you\u2019ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We\u2019ll come back to it at the end of the post. It\u2019s time now for a deep dive\u2014let\u2019s think about this from scratch. From first principles. ___________ In the cook-chef post , I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram. The first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable. The second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve\u2014based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area. The overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices\u2014the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool. This is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let\u2019s start with the Want Box. Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box The hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things\u2014or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants\u2014and fears\u2014its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it\u2019ll specifically mean going directly against others. The Want Box is a game of compromise. The Yearning Octopus To do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus. We each have our own personal Yearning Octopus 5 in our heads. The particulars of each person\u2019s Yearning Octopus will vary, but people also aren\u2019t all that different from each other, and I bet many of us feel very similar yearnings and fears (especially given that I find that Wait But Why readers tend to have a lot in common). The first thing to think about is that there are totally distinct yearning worlds \u2014each living on one tentacle. These tentacles often do not get along with each other. It gets worse. Each tentacle is made up of a bunch of different individual yearnings and their accompanying fears\u2014and these often massively conflict with each other too. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each tentacle to see what\u2019s going on. The Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here\u2014it\u2019s pretty particular to each of us. It\u2019s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It\u2019s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don\u2019t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach\u2014it\u2019s a highly needy tentacle. And yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it\u2019s the ickiest set of yearnings to really go for; because the fears of this tentacle aren\u2019t scary in an immediate way\u2014they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person\u2014who may believe they got successful in the wrong field. The Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures. As we\u2019ve discussed before on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who\u2019s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn\u2019t want to be in the outgroup. He\u2019s quite cute though. Then there\u2019s your ego, who\u2019s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn\u2019t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon\u2014ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known. There are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren\u2019t judging you fairly\u2014if you\u2019re not appropriately appreciated. It\u2019s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges\u2014which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to show that person or those people who never believed in them. Finally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you\u2019re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It\u2019s probably a parent.) The Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day\u2014with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries. It\u2019s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible\u2014as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible. The issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it\u2019s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn\u2019t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson. The Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks\u2014each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth\u2014a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to deploy . Needless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can\u2019t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy\u2019s sake\u2014they think, \u201cOther people aren\u2019t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?\u201d\u2014but they can understand philanthropy for their own motive\u2019s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground\u2014the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it\u2019ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people\u2019s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor. That\u2019s why, when you do something philanthropic\u2014or anything altruistic, really\u2014there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you determined to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks \u201cGod I\u2019m a good person\u201d lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, not doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles\u2014the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem. Your Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great\u2014but it would also like to point out that it\u2019s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it\u2019s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they\u2019d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn\u2019t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can\u2019t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll & Hyde sophomore year of college. At its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn\u2019t really care how these things happen\u2014it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle\u2019s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don\u2019t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren\u2019t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because \u201cit\u2019s not a good look,\u201d with your personal tentacle chiming in that \u201cyeah, we\u2019re better than that.\u201d So that\u2019s the situation. You\u2019ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren\u2019t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a single yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can\u2019t figure out what it\u2019s most passionate about. Or when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still. Or when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity\u2019s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community\u2014while the part of you that can\u2019t stand the thought of the millions of today\u2019s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless. So yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus\u2014that\u2019s why you\u2019ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise. Dissecting the Octopus With that in mind, let\u2019s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus\u2014which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind\u2019s subconscious can we see what\u2019s really going on. 6 The cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It\u2019s not off-limits to us\u2014it\u2019s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime\u2014we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck. So let\u2019s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you\u2019re one of those people who\u2019s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it. Like if there\u2019s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career\u2014and which specific parts of those tentacles? If you\u2019re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid of failing, unpack that . Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that\u2019s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image\u2014of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn\u2019t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle\u2014in other words, is it possible you\u2019re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the message a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you\u2019ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap? Perhaps you don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fear of failure that\u2019s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it\u2019s a dread of the change in identity\u2014both internally and externally\u2014that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it\u2019s the heavy weight of inertia\u2014an intense resistance to change\u2014that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you\u2019d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia. Maybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it. As you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it\u2019s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning\u2014instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation. The answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity. You\u2019ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You\u2019ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy. Searching for Imposters We\u2019re making good progress\u2014but we\u2019re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work\u2014work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination. You\u2019ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don\u2019t materialize out of nowhere. They\u2019re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they\u2019re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they\u2019re the product of either you the chef or you the cook. So the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it\u2019s authentically you, or if it\u2019s someone else disguised as you. You can pull on a yearning\u2019s face by playing the Why Game. You\u2019ll ask your initial Why\u2014 Why is this something I want?\u2014 and get to some kind of Because. Then you\u2019ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You\u2019ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you\u2019ll usually discover one of three things: 1) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You\u2019ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real. 2) You\u2019ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you\u2014 I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me\u2014 and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it\u2019s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning\u2019s original installer underneath. 3) You\u2019ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of \u201cI guess I just know this because it\u2019s true!\u201d This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can\u2019t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you\u2019ll have a hunch about which it is. In a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It\u2019s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value. In a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you\u2019ve discovered that you\u2019ve been duped. You\u2019ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren\u2019t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you\u2019re a cook following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else\u2019s brain. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you\u2019re like me and most of my friends\u2014your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you\u2019ll find your mom. You\u2019ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what\u2019s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends. Sometimes you\u2019ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated. You might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you\u2026when you were seven years old. Like a childhood dream that was etched into the back of your consciousness as the thing you believe you really want, when you\u2019re being truly honest. The interrogation room probably won\u2019t be that fun a time. But it\u2019s time well spent\u2014because you\u2019re not your 7-year-old self, just like you\u2019re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You\u2019re Current-Age You\u2014the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don\u2019t want. To be clear, this isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by definition influence-able\u2014influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this: Do you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you\u2019ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, masquerading as inner you? Do you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, \u201cI don\u2019t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right\u201d\u2014and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them? The former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you\u2019re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are. The good news is that all humans make this mistake\u2014and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it\u2014it\u2019s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It\u2019s your head\u2014you\u2019re allowed to do with it what you want. So it\u2019s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go. Even mom and dad. At the end of this, your octopus may look a little barren, leaving you feeling a little like you don\u2019t know who you even are anymore. We usually think of this as a bad feeling, or even an existential crisis, but it actually means you\u2019re doing better than most people. The drop from naive over-confidence to wise, realistic humility never feels good, but pausing the roller coaster while it\u2019s still on that first cliff and avoiding the pain\u2014which turns out to be a lot of people\u2019s move\u2014isn\u2019t a great strategy. Wisdom isn\u2019t correlated with knowledge, it\u2019s correlated with being in touch with reality\u2014it\u2019s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it\u2019s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it\u2019s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves\u2014because they fundamentally don\u2019t get how knowing yourself works. They haven\u2019t reached that stage yet. Getting to know your real self is super hard and never complete. But if you\u2019ve tumbled off the cliff, you\u2019ve gone through a key rite of passage and progress is now possible. As you climb up the orange line, you\u2019ll slowly but surely begin to repopulate your Yearning Octopus with your real self. At the moment, it probably won\u2019t be obvious what those missing yearnings of yours are exactly\u2014because they\u2019re on an even deeper floor of your subconscious. They\u2019re in the basement of the basement of the basement\u2014in a place called Denial Prison. Denial Prison Our brain\u2019s Denial Prison is a place most of us don\u2019t even know is there\u2014it\u2019s where we put the parts of us we repress and deny. The authentic yearnings of ours that we\u2019re in touch with\u2014i.e. those that proved to be authentic during interrogation\u2014were easy parts of our true selves to find in our subconscious, lying in plain sight, right below the surface of our consciousness. Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with. But then there are the parts of you that weren\u2019t living on your octopus where they\u2019re supposed to be\u2014instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they\u2019ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it\u2019s almost not there at all. Almost. Some parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they\u2019re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution\u2014i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone else locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn\u2019t really you and isn\u2019t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell. So let\u2019s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find. You may pass some unpleasant characters. Leave them for another time\u2014right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you\u2019ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition. There will be certain parts of your authentic self you won\u2019t be able to uncover in Denial Prison\u2014it\u2019s pretty dark down there. But be patient\u2014now that you\u2019ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge. Priority Rankings The other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they\u2019re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it\u2019s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you\u2019re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else\u2014some source of fear or inertia in you\u2014is currently being prioritized above it. It\u2019s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you\u2019ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don\u2019t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it\u2019s because you\u2019re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running away from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don\u2019t believe you actually care that much about, you\u2019re probably not looking closely enough at your fears. With both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: \u201cWho made this order? Was it really me?\u201d For example, we\u2019re often told to \u201cfollow our passion\u201d\u2014this is society saying \u201cput your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.\u201d That\u2019s a very specific instruction. Maybe that\u2019s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It\u2019s something you need to independently evaluate. To get this right, let\u2019s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we\u2019ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now. This isn\u2019t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable\u2014if it were, you\u2019d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is you \u2014the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you\u2019ll try to tap into all the wisdom you\u2019ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values\u2014about what you really believe is important . On the other side, it\u2019s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you\u2019ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you\u2019re not super proud of\u2014whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what\u2019s important and what\u2019s you. It\u2019s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it\u2019s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well\u2014depending on where you decide to draw the line. There\u2019s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely. To get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you\u2014I like the idea of a shelf: This divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings so important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they\u2019ll happen\u2014at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history\u2019s legends were famously single-minded\u2014they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly\u2014if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or maybe two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all. Your group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices\u2014but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that\u2019s why it\u2019s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You\u2019re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you\u2019re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they\u2019re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable. That\u2019s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they\u2019ll often demand it\u2014core parts of you won\u2019t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they\u2019re neglected. Most of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, \u201cI know you want these things, but for now, I\u2019ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I\u2019ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you\u2019ll get a shelf upgrade then.\u201d The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the top shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf. Then there\u2019s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject\u2014those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people\u2019s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash. As you go through this difficult prioritizing process\u2014inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings\u2014remember that you\u2019re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can\u2019t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment\u2014motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won\u2019t be the wise adult in the room\u2014that\u2019s your job. Finally, as we\u2019ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It\u2019s the opposite\u2014it\u2019s a rough draft written in light pencil. It\u2019s a hypothesis that you\u2019ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice. Your Want Box is ready to go. Now let\u2019s turn to your Reality Box. Deep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box The Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what\u2019s possible . But when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it\u2019s not necessarily based on what you actually want\u2014it\u2019s based on what you think you want\u2014what you\u2019re in the habit of wanting. The Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn\u2019t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be\u2014your perception of reality. The goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what\u2019s possible to come close to mirroring what\u2019s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings\u2014your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of beliefs . When it comes to your career possibilities, you\u2019re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area. Us being us, we\u2019re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately. I don\u2019t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this: There are traditional careers\u2014stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.\u2014and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you\u2019re decently smart and work hard, you\u2019ll end up in a successful, stable situation. Then there are less traditional careers\u2014the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.\u2014and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it\u2019s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two. These are perfectly reasonable assumptions\u2014if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did\u2014and I suspect that behind most of them, you\u2019ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach\u2014but if you keep going and pull on their face, you\u2019ll usually see that it\u2019s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic 7 \u2014none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society. Today\u2019s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we\u2019re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth. These problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers\u2014and you also conflate talent and skill level\u2014it won\u2019t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we\u2019re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, \u201cI can get there one day\u2014just need to do about 20 years of hard work.\u201d But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they\u2019re more likely to think, \u201cWow look how talented they are\u2014I\u2019m nowhere near that good,\u201d and get all hopeless. There\u2019s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some \u201cbig break\u201d at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot\u2014and I don\u2019t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards. These are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let\u2019s brainstorm how it might actually work: The Career Landscape I have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly. But that\u2019s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet. First, there\u2019s the broad landscape\u2014the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today\u2019s society. My current job description is: \u201cWriter of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.\u201d Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options\u2014some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology\u2014and the way things work today, if there\u2019s an option you want that\u2019s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting. Then, there\u2019s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today\u2019s available game boards\u2014and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career\u2019s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it\u2019s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength. This is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, and it\u2019s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage. Your Potential And this brings us to you and your particular strengths. Not only do we assess our strengths based on the wrong game boards (like in our basketball example)\u2014even when we have the right game board in mind, we\u2019re often bad at identifying the real strengths that that game calls for. When assessing your chances on a certain career path, the key question is: With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career? I like to view this journey to \u201cgood enough at the game to succeed\u201d as a distance. The distance starts with where you are now\u2014point A\u2014and ends with you reaching your definition of success, which we can draw with a star. The length of the distance depends on where point A is (how far along you are at the current moment) and where the star is (how lofty your definition of success is). So if you\u2019re a college graduate who majored in computer science and your career goal is to be a middle-of-the-ladder engineer at Google, your distance might look like this: But if you\u2019ve never done any kind of computer science before, and your career goal is to be the top engineer at Google, you\u2019ve got a much longer road ahead: If your goal is to create the new Google, the road gets much, much longer. At this point, conventional wisdom might emerge as a voice in your head and point out that simply getting good enough at a certain skill doesn\u2019t actually guarantee success\u2014you might reach the star on a career path and still find that you haven\u2019t \u201cmade it\u201d yet. That\u2019s mostly wrong, because it\u2019s misunderstanding the star. The star isn\u2019t about a particular skill level\u2014e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy\u2014it\u2019s about the entire game . In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward\u2014if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you\u2019ve probably hit your star and you\u2019ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the \u201cI want to be a famous actor\u201d star doesn\u2019t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor game as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle\u2014you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that whole game\u2014every component of it\u2014your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. That\u2019s what hitting the star means. But conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t get how non-traditional careers work\u2014it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it \u201cluck.\u201d To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot. So how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It\u2019s all about a simple formula: Distance = Speed x Time. In our case, the more apt wording might be: Progress = Pace x Persistence. Your outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you\u2019ll be able to improve at playing that career\u2019s \u201cgame\u201d and B) the amount of time you\u2019re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let\u2019s talk about both of these: Pace What makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I\u2019d say it comes down to three factors: Your level of chefness. As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they\u2019ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else\u2019s recipe\u2014in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at\u2014then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop\u2026 \u2026while cooks improve at a snail\u2019s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What\u2019s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef\u2019s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook\u2019s recipe just grows more and more outdated\u2014a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I\u2019m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement. Your work ethic. This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who\u2019s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus. Your natural abilities. Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don\u2019t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people\u2014and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types. Other things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they\u2019re not components of pace\u2014they\u2019re part of the location of point A. Persistence When I say persistence, I\u2019m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you\u2019re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you\u2019ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours. And this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they\u2019re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they\u2019ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn\u2019t matter how awesome you are\u2014if you\u2019ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you\u2019re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace. Your Real Strengths and W eaknesses With our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let\u2019s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not that \u201cstrengths and weaknesses\u201d is a bad concept\u2014it\u2019s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness 8 or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag. Most importantly, these items shouldn\u2019t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your potential for improvement in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he\u2019d suck. But calling basketball a \u201cweakness\u201d of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you\u2019d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills\u2014but most general pace and persistence qualities can also be worked on and improved if you focus on them. Filling in the Reality Box Your true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you\u2019d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it\u2019s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box\u2014just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset. 9 So to be a bit more efficient, let\u2019s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate: 1) The general landscape. Take our best crack at evaluating the world\u2019s current career landscape\u2014the full range of options available (or create-able). 2) Specific game boards. For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career\u2019s current game board\u2014the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc. 3) Starting point. For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field. 4) Success point. Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what\u2019s the minimum level of success you\u2019d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path. 5) Your pace. Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to accelerate ). 6) Your level of persistence. Evaluate the amount of time you think you\u2019ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths. Now it\u2019s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path\u2019s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it\u2019s good to at least know the equation you\u2019re working with. A from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction. A good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn\u2019t considered wanting because you hadn\u2019t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them. This brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive. After a fairly exhausting box-auditing process, we can return to our Venn 10 diagram. Assuming some things have changed, you have a new Option Pool to look at\u2014a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve. We\u2019re ready now to return to where we were before we started our analysis: the present moment. With these options in front of us, we\u2019re ready to lift our heads up out of analysis and look forward into the future. Connecting the Dots into the Future It\u2019s time to bring back your Career Plans map that I made you put down at the beginning of the post\u2014the one with the arrow or the question mark. If there had been a clear arrow on your map before your audit, check out your new Option Pool. Given everything you\u2019ve reflected upon, does your current career plan still qualify to be there? If so, congrats\u2014you\u2019re ahead of most of us. If not, well that\u2019s shitty news, but it\u2019s also good news. Remember, going from a false arrow to a question mark is always major progress in life. And actually, a new question mark implies having made the key cliff jump on two roller coasters: getting to know yourself and getting to know the world. Major step in the right direction. Cross out the arrow and join the question mark crowd. Now the question mark crowd has a tough choice. You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool. It\u2019s a tough choice\u2014but it should be way less tough than it is. Here\u2019s why: Careers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement. The truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out kind of like tunnels. Today\u2019s careers\u2014especially the less traditional ones\u2014are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder. When you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn\u2019t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they\u2019ll want to be decades from now\u2014which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster. When you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing. When you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they\u2019re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh. But conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake\u2014on top of helping us yearn for things we don\u2019t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren\u2019t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren\u2019t accurate\u2014conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily. Today\u2019s career landscape isn\u2019t a lineup of tunnels, it\u2019s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today\u2019s people aren\u2019t synonymous with what they do\u2014they\u2019re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today\u2019s career isn\u2019t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label\u2014it\u2019s a long series of science experiments. Steve Jobs compared life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it\u2019s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it\u2019s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards. If you look at the biographies of your heroes, you\u2019ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you\u2019ll probably see the same trend\u2014according to data , the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer\u201410.4 years on average). So seeing your career as a series of dots isn\u2019t a mental trick to help you make decisions\u2014it\u2019s an accurate depiction of what\u2019s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn\u2019t just unproductive\u2014it\u2019s delusional. Likewise, you\u2019re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path\u2014because it\u2019s the only dot you can figure out. You don\u2019t have to worry about dot #4 because you can\u2019t anyway\u2014you\u2019re literally not qualified to do so. By the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don\u2019t know now. You\u2019ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You\u2019ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you\u2019re interested in, and you\u2019ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape\u2014and those game boards\u2014will have themselves evolved. The fantastic website 80,000 Hours (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that you\u2019ll change , that the world will change , and that you\u2019ll only learn with time what you\u2019re actually good at . Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently describes just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future. Pretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let\u2019s focus on dot #1. If we\u2019re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out. Hypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you\u2019d tell her, \u201cYou can\u2019t figure this out on your couch\u2014you\u2019ve gotta start going on dates, and that\u2019ll teach you what you want in a partner.\u201d If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you\u2019d again have to correct her. You\u2019d say, \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.\u201d We can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let\u2019s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation\u2014it\u2019s just a first date. This is awesome news\u2014because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it\u2019s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today\u2019s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday\u2019s world. That\u2019s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful. And that\u2019s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part. Making Your Move You\u2019ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You\u2019ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move. We\u2019re super bad at this. We\u2019re frightened people. We don\u2019t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there\u2019s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here\u2019s where it\u2019ll show itself. The Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you\u2019ve decided on a life step and you can\u2019t quite take it, it\u2019s because the parts of you that don\u2019t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You\u2019re a CEO not in control of their staff. To fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do? Go talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They\u2019re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you\u2019ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You\u2019re the teacher\u2014figure it out. The older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life\u2019s struggle. The world is easy\u2014 you\u2019re difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you\u2019ve uncovered your new #1 priority\u2014becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know. If your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you\u2019re able to make the jump. After the Move Jumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc. First of all, for a while at least, you\u2019ll probably suck at what you\u2019re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that\u2019s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they\u2019ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won\u2019t be feeling much gratification yet, and they\u2019ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn\u2019t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won\u2019t be much fun. Even if things do go well, you\u2019ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you\u2019ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down\u2014the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You\u2019ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up. As you get wiser, you\u2019ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You\u2019ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it\u2019s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be. The whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions\u2014like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer\u2019s outing\u2014they\u2019re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them\u2014but they\u2019re not the new normal, and they never will be. A better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you\u2019re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you\u2019re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise. People talk about being present in the moment, but there\u2019s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you\u2019re on a career dot that, when you\u2019re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You\u2019ll come back to the big picture later\u2014for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just live . These moments don\u2019t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you\u2019ve got into the dot you\u2019ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing. The Next Dot? At some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you\u2019ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness. Sometimes, the macro mission won\u2019t be the problem. It\u2019ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn\u2019t a release of persistence but the stuff of persistence. This is the mission-enhancing type of dot jump. Other times, you\u2019ll feel a darker kind of restlessness\u2014the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you\u2019ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A mission-changing dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move. In these moments, it\u2019s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum: The people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy\u2014the wing-footed\u2014and they have the opposite pitfall: they\u2019re quick quitters. 11 (You should be especially wary of cement feet\u2014psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is \u201cI wish I had quit earlier,\u201d and the most common advice of the elderly is, \u201c Don\u2019t stay in a job you dislike. \u201c) This is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what\u2019s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving\u2014some blue or yellow loop activity: If you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission: If a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank \u201cgetting wise about dot-jumping\u201d pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape. Looking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I\u2019ll be to repeat them in the future. Remembering that you\u2019re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn\u2019t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy\u2014but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It\u2019s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It\u2019s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way. ___________ Over the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I\u2019ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret. I\u2019ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there\u2019s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren\u2019t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live\u2014the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious. My own psyche seems to back this up\u2014looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self\u2014the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn\u2019t to avoid mistakes, it\u2019s for the mistakes I do make to be my own. That\u2019s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that\u2019s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you\u2014you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right. _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

A Venn diagram is the most obvious possible kind of diagram, and somehow, John Venn convinced everyone he invented it. And this is despite openly saying he didn\u2019t invent it . Venn explains: \u201cI began at once somewhat more steady work on the subjects and books which I should have to lecture on. I now first hit upon the diagrammatical device of representing propositions by inclusive and exclusive circles. Of course the device was not new then, but it was so obviously representative of the way in which any one, who approached the subject from the mathematical side, would attempt to visualize propositions, that it was forced upon me almost at once.\u201d \u21a9 This spectrum, of course, is also highly relevant in relationships. \u21a9 Tweet About Tim Urban View all posts by Tim Urban \u2192 Previous Post Next Post RECOMMENDED POSTS 100 Blocks a Day October 21, 2016 The Marriage Decision: Everything Forever or Nothing Ev...

That leaves 16 or 17 hours awake each day. Or about 1,000 minutes. Let\u2019s think about those 1,000 minutes as 100 10-minute blocks. That\u2019s what you wake up with every day. Throughout the day, you spend 10 minutes of your life on each block, until you eventually run out of blocks and it\u2019s time to go to sleep. It\u2019s always good to step back and think about how we\u2019re using those 100 blocks we get each day. How many of them are put towards making your future better, and how many of them are just there to be enjoyed? How many of them are spent with other people, and how many are for time by yourself? How many are used to create something, and how many are used to consume something? How many of the blocks are focused on your body, how many on your mind, and how many on neither one in particular? Which are your favorite blocks of the day, and which are your least favorite? Imagine these blocks laid out on a grid. What if you had to label each one with a purpose? You\u2019d have to think about everything you might spend your time doing in the context of its worth in blocks. Cooking dinner requires three blocks, while ordering in requires zero\u2014is cooking dinner worth three blocks to you? Is 10 minutes of meditation a day important enough to dedicate a block to it? Reading 20 minutes a night allows you to read 15 additional books a year\u2014is that worth two blocks? If your favorite recreation is playing video games, you\u2019d have to consider the value you place on fun before deciding how many blocks it warrants. Getting a drink with a friend after work takes up about 10 blocks. How often do you want to use 10 blocks for that purpose, and on which friends? Which blocks should be treated as non-negotiable in their labeled purpose and which should be more flexible? Which blocks should be left blank, with no assigned purpose at all? Now imagine a similar grid, but one where each block is labeled exactly how you spent it yesterday. The question to ask is: How are the two grids different from each other, and why? ___________ Tip: the above grid is printable if you click on it. ___________ While we\u2019re all in this mood: Your whole life on a grid. A stark reminder. And if you\u2019re sitting down with a printed grid, this might be a good post to read first. _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

New Year\u2019s Day, 2013. \u00a0I\u2019m going about my afternoon pleasantly, when I open my email and a friend has forwarded me what she calls a particularly heinous Facebook status from her news feed, written by someone we\u2019ll call Daniel. \u00a0It read: 2012 was a biggg year for me. I left my amazing job at NBC to move back to Chicago. I started dating my angel, Jaime Holland. I started yoga (thanks Jake Fisher\u00a0& Jonah Perlstein!). I wrote an album with Matthew Johannson. Wrote another album I\u2019m proud of. I got to hang with Owen Wilson, and worked with Will Ferrell on an amazing project. Had a conversation about Barack Obama with David Gregory. Danced. Joined a kickball team. Won a couple awards. Helped my sister plan her summer trip. Swam a lot. Golfed a little. Cried more than you would think. Read The World According to Garp. Saw Apocolypse Now. Went to Miami for the NBA Finals. Drank the best orange juice I\u2019ve ever had with Davey Welch. Tweeted. Went to amazing weddings in Upstate New York. Drank a ridiculous amount of milk. Learned how to make sand art. Saw a great light show. Saw the Angels and Lakers. Fell in love with Jawbone Up. Cooked with Jaime. Gardened with Jaime. Watched Homeland with Jaime. Wrestled with Jaime. Laughed for hours with Jaime. Fell in love with Jaime\u2019s family. Worked on a play. Played World of Warcraft. Did some improv. Played a ton of the guitar. Really just had a wild, amazing year. What a world. By the time I finished reading, I realized that my non-phone hand was clutching tightly to my forehead, forcefully scrunching my forehead skin together. \u00a0I had the same facial expression I\u2019d have on if someone made me watch a live event where people had their skin slowly peeled off. It was everything bad about everything, all at once. But instead of distancing myself from the horror, I soaked in it. \u00a0I read it again and again, fascinated by how something could be so aggressively unappealing. It made me think about what makes terrible Facebook behavior terrible, and why other Facebook behavior isn\u2019t annoying at all. \u00a0It comes down to a pretty simple rule: A Facebook status is annoying if it primarily serves the author and does nothing positive for anyone reading it. To examine this a bit, let\u2019s start by discussing the defining characteristics of statuses that are not annoying. To be unannoying, a Facebook status typically has to be one of two things: 1) Interesting/Informative 2) Funny/Amusing/Entertaining You know why these are unannoying? Because things in those two categories do something for me, the reader. They make my day a little better. Ideally, interesting statuses would be fascinating and original (or a link to something that is), and funny ones would be hilarious. But I\u2019ll happily take mildly amusing \u2014at least we\u2019re still dealing with the good guys. On the other hand, annoying statuses typically reek of one or more of these five motivations: 1) Image Crafting. The author wants to affect the way people think of her. 2) Narcissism. The author\u2019s thoughts, opinions, and life philosophies matter. The author and the author\u2019s life are interesting in and of themselves. 3) Attention Craving. The author wants attention. 4) Jealousy Inducing. The author wants to make people jealous of him or his life. 5) Loneliness. The author is feeling lonely and wants Facebook to make it better. This is the least heinous of the five\u2014but seeing a lonely person acting lonely on Facebook makes me and everyone else sad. So the person is essentially spreading their sadness, and that\u2019s a shitty thing to do, so it\u2019s on the list. Facebook is infested with these five motivations\u2014other than a few really saintly people, most people I know, myself certainly included, are guilty of at least some of this nonsense here and there. \u00a0It\u2019s an epidemic. To lay out the most common types of offenses: 7 Ways to Be Insufferable on Facebook 1) The Brag Bragging is such a staple of unfortunate Facebook behavior, it needs to be broken into three subsections: 1a) The \u201cI\u2019m Living Quite the Life\u201d Brag Description: A post making your life sound great, either in a macro sense (got your dream job, got your degree, love your new apartment) or a micro sense (taking off on an amazing trip, huge weekend coming up, heading out on a fun night with friends, just had an amazing day) Examples: Guess who just got her TFA acceptance letter!!! Hawaii! Tailgating, Giants game, night out with Dave, Matt, Paul, and Andy. I love you, Saturday. Core reasons for posting: Image Crafting (I\u2019m successful; I\u2019m happy; I have a great social life), Jealousy Inducing So at best, you\u2019re just really excited about your life and you need to tell everyone, and at worst you\u2019re specifically hoping to make people feel worse about their lives and jealous of yours. Somewhere in the middle would be you calculatingly crafting your words as part of an unendearing and transparent campaign to make people see you in a certain way. Let\u2019s give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you\u2019re just excited and need to brag to someone. Even if that\u2019s the case, the only people it\u2019s okay to brag to in life are your close friends, significant other, and family members\u2014and that\u2019s what email, texting, phone calls, and live talking are for. Your moment of self-satisfaction is profoundly annoying to people you\u2019re not that close with, and they make up the vast majority of people who will be subjected to the status. 1b) The Undercover Brag Description: Like the blatant brags above except behind a frail disguise. This includes all humblebrags , indirect brags, brags disguised as a rant, etc. Examples: Apparently they now give PhDs to frauds and drunks. What a time to be alive! I\u2019ll be traveling for the summer if anyone knows someone looking to sublease a Soho apartment in July and August. On my walk home from work, I was whistled at twice, honked at twice, and one car almost caused an accident slowing down to stare at me. Sometimes I really hate men. Core reasons for posting: Image Crafting, Jealousy Inducing On one hand, these people are at least self-aware enough to cloak their brag in something. On the other hand, they have the same exact core motivations as the blatant braggers and looking at these examples actually makes the first group seem almost lovable in comparison. 1c) The \u201cI\u2019m in a Great Relationship\u201d Brag Description: A public expression of your extremely positive feelings for your significant other or an anecdote signifying the perfection of your relationship. Examples: A surprise trip to Vermont for two nights in a cabin. All I can say is Wow, what a boyfriend. Thanks, Rachel, for the best year of my life. Excited for a rainy Sunday of pizza, games, and movies with the wife. Core reasons for posting: Image Crafting (FYI, I have a boyfriend; I\u2019m in a wonderful relationship), Jealousy Inducing The image crafting and jealousy inducing motives here are transparent. The only less-appalling possibility could be that it\u2019s an attempt to strengthen the relationship itself by showing how you feel in a more substantial way than just saying it in private. But really? You\u2019re gonna drag 800 of us into this shit because you couldn\u2019t find a more creative way to go over the top in expressing yourself? The one very funny possibility when it\u2019s a guy posting is that either he\u2019s in trouble for something or that his girlfriend\u2019s friend\u2019s boyfriend pulled some shit like this at some point and his girlfriend has now been 10% mad at him ever since it happened, so he finally has to just bite the bullet. The fact is, there\u2019s no excuse for it, because if you feel the need to plaster your relationship all over Facebook, there are plenty of socially acceptable ways to do so\u2014go nuts with couple profile photos, and enjoy three separate moments of like button and comment applause when you change your status to \u201cin a relationship,\u201d \u201cengaged,\u201d and \u201cmarried.\u201d 2) The Cryptic Cliffhanger Description: A post that makes it clear that something good or bad is happening in your life without disclosing any details. Examples: That\u2019s IT. I am DONE dating. This could be a biggggg day\u2026 Moments like these make all of the struggle and all of the pain worth it. Ughhhhhhhhh Core reasons for posting: Attention Craving The fun part of these is watching the inevitable comments and then watching how the author responds to them, if at all. This process slots the author into one of four sub-categories: The celebrity: The author stays silent, treating the commenters like gawking fans. 800 people\u2019s collective high-maintenance girlfriend: The author explains everything in the comments, which means he wanted to talk publicly about it, but he didn\u2019t want to just tell the public, he wanted the public to ask him about it. The tortured protagonist: It\u2019s something bad. The author responds but maintains the mystery\u2014she\u2019s unhappy about it and she \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like getting into it.\u201d Everybody\u2019s special princess: It\u2019s something exciting. The author responds but maintains the mystery\u2014it\u2019s really good and he \u201ccan\u2019t say yet but you\u2019ll find out soon!\u201d Now you\u2019ll have an extra hop in your step as you wait for the big news with bated breath! This is a special one because it also brings Narcissism, Jealousy Inducing, and Image Crafting in. What a fun person to have in your life! 3) The Literal Status Update Description: An actual status update on someone\u2019s mundane day. Examples: Off to the gym, then class reading Dumplings! Finally finished my paper! Core reasons for posting: Loneliness; Narcissism; Thinking a status update is supposed to be an actual status update Allow me to present a visual\u2014 \u201cFinally finished my paper!\u201d Okay\u2026 and? What are you looking for here? A fake congratulation from a bunch of people who aren\u2019t emotionally invested in your struggle? Finishing your paper is green territory on the above chart, or if you had been working on it for a couple months, it might scrape the outer edges of the orange. For 90+% of the people who will read the status, it doesn\u2019t come near the red territory, which is all they care about. Off to the gym, then class reading . Oh is that what\u2019s on tap for tonight? Who exactly are you telling this to? I really want to get to the bottom of this. At some point between leaving work and arriving at the gym, you had an impulse to take out your phone and type this status. Then you put your phone away. Tell me what was accomplished. We\u2019re talking about serious blue territory here, which means that even your mom doesn\u2019t give a shit. A lot of annoying statuses fall far from red territory, but they all serve the author in some way, which is why they\u2019re posted. But info about your schedule doesn\u2019t do anything to craft your image or induce jealousy in anyone\u2014so it just seems a lot like Attention Craving\u2019s sad cousin, Loneliness. I suppose it\u2019s nice that Facebook gives a lonely person someone to tell their day to, and if these statuses didn\u2019t come with the byproduct of reminding everyone else that life is meaningless and they\u2019re gonna die someday, they wouldn\u2019t have to be on this list. The other possible explanation is severe narcissism, as if somehow, because you\u2019re you, even the smallest details of your life are interesting to others. A weird part of the life of a major celebrity is that people are obsessed with everything about them, even their blue territory. If you\u2019re not a major celebrity, this is not a problem you have, I promise. 4) The Inexplicably-Public Private Message Description: A public posting from one person to another that has no good reason to be public. Examples: I miss you! When are we hanging out? What a weekend with Julie Epstein and Emily Rothchild . \u00a0I love my girls! All private jokes. Core reasons for posting: Image Crafting; Jealousy Inducing; Narcissism; You\u2019re over 80 and don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a difference between a public post and a private message. My grandmother aside, there is no good reason to ever do this. Good is the key word. There are lots of very annoying reasons to do this. Let\u2019s list them: To make yourself seem cool and social and make your social life seem vibrant and fun To show everyone what good friends you and the recipient are To make people jealous or feel worse about their own lives Because you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re in high school and you\u2019re one of the popular kids whose social situation is actually an important thing for people The one possibility I enjoy is that the message is written to be jealousy-inducing specifically for one individual who will likely be seeing it, whether it be an ex or a friend they hate. That kind of malice is so extreme it crosses over the far line and becomes awesome. 5) The Out-Of-Nowhere Oscar Acceptance Speech Description: An outpouring of love for no clear reason and aimed at no one in particular Example: I just want to say how thankful I am for all of you who have touched my life. Your support means everything and I couldn\u2019t have gotten through a lot of things in the last year without you! Core reasons for posting: Attention Craving I refuse to believe you feel a genuine outpouring of love for your 800 Facebook friends. And if you felt suddenly emotional about your best friends and family, is a public status really the way you\u2019d express it? Wouldn\u2019t contacting a few people by email or text be a lot more personal and genuine? Not relevant, because that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. What\u2019s happening here can really be boiled down to, \u201cHey everyone! I\u2019m here! Hug me!\u201d You know the inevitable response to one of these statuses, no matter who you are, will be dozens of like button hugs and comment arm squeezes. And isn\u2019t that a little needy of you? You\u2019re not feeling loving when you write this post\u2014you\u2019re feeling the need to feel loved. The one time this is somewhat acceptable is when it\u2019s part of a huge collective group hug, like on Thanksgiving or Christmas. If you open Facebook on Thanksgiving, you\u2019ll be treated to hundreds of Out-Of-Nowhere Oscar Acceptance Speeches. (These I could also do without, if you\u2019re wondering.) 6) The Incredibly Obvious Opinion Description: When a big event happens, a post chiming in with the opinion we\u2019ve heard 1,000 times. Examples: I feel so deeply for the Egyptian people fighting for their right to freedom. Everyone has a right to freedom and I pray that they prevail. My thoughts and prayers are with the families in Newtown after this unspeakable tragedy. I have no words to express my sorrow for those who lost a child. I\u2019m disappointed about some things about Obama\u2019s first term, but I\u2019m happy he was reelected and hopeful about what his second term can bring. Core reasons for posting: Narcissism; Image Crafting (I\u2019m the kind of person that has this particular opinion or reaction; I\u2019m smart and I can say adult things) These are annoying because A) you\u2019re not saying anything remotely original or interesting on an event the media is already flooding our airways about, covering every possible angle, and B) you\u2019re now making a huge, and often tragic event, partially about you. The sadness you\u2019re feeling about the massacre of children isn\u2019t really a key piece of the puzzle here, and you need not describe to us what the event looks like through your personal lens, especially when the lens is just transparent glass\u2014if I want a side dish of narcissism along with my tragedy, I\u2019ll just read celebrity tweets about the event. 7) The Step Toward Enlightenment Description: An unsolicited nugget of wisdom. Examples: \u201cPeace comes from within. Do not seek it without.\u201d ~Buddha Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. ~Proverbs 3:5-6 I don\u2019t see what the big deal is about new years and people claiming how different they are going to be next year. If you want to better yourself it shouldn\u2019t matter what day of the year it is\u2026. Me? Im going to be the same person I am today tomorrow. Core reasons for posting: Image Crafting; Narcissism Oh, where to begin. First of all, let\u2019s be entirely clear that there is no humility involved in a Step Toward Enlightenment post simply because you might be quoting someone else\u2014the clear patronizing message is, \u201cAhh hello Facebook Friends. I am one who knows the secrets of life\u2014allow me to teach you so that you too can one day find enlightenment.\u201d Secondly\u2014you know what inspires people? You achieving something incredible and letting it be an example and inspiration to others. For your words alone to be inspirational, you need to be a gifted speaker or writer who really has something original to say\u2014and we both know that\u2019s not you. So for you to consider yourself an inspirational character by simply posting trite quotes is, well, flagrantly narcissistic. You\u2019re assuming that you, just by being you, are inspirational. Thirdly, let\u2019s get to your real motive with these statuses\u2014Image Crafting. You want people to see how enlightened you are and admire the spiritual journey you\u2019re on. * * * Our friend Daniel\u2019s post was quite a feat\u2014in one simple paragraph, he sliced through my soul, accomplishing nearly every terrible status type and motivation discussed above. The thing is, though, that if you looked right below his post, all you saw were likes and a couple friendly comments. And that\u2019s why insufferable Facebook behavior will never go away\u2014there\u2019s no dislike button or eye-roll button or middle finger button on Facebook, and it\u2019s bad form to be too much of a dick in the comments below a status. So annoying statuses are just positively reinforced, and people remain un-self-aware that they regularly bring down the quality of everyone else\u2019s life. The bigger point here is that the qualities of annoying statuses are normal human qualities\u2014everyone needs to brag to someone here and there, everyone has moments of weakness when they need attention or feel lonely, and everyone has some downright ugly qualities that are gonna come out at one time or another. And that\u2019s why you have people who love you. The thing that Daniel and most others haven\u2019t internalized is the fact that if they have 800 Facebook friends, only about 10 or 15 love them. For an especially lovable person, maybe it\u2019s as high as 30. Between 1 and 4%. That means that between 96 and 99% of your Facebook friends DO NOT LOVE YOU. People who don\u2019t love you don\u2019t care about you or your day or your life that much, they\u2019re probably not especially rooting for you, and they certainly want nothing to do with your worst qualities. And you doing something purely to serve your emotional or egotistical needs really should not show up on their computer screen\u2014it just shouldn\u2019t. Okay, gotta go. Off to the gym, then dinner, then home, then bed.

Buy it here. (Or see a preview .) Note: The reason this post took three weeks to finish is that as I dug into research on Artificial Intelligence, I could not believe what I was reading. It hit me pretty quickly that what\u2019s happening in the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future. So I wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and once I did that, I wanted to make sure I wrote a post that really explained this whole situation and why it matters so much. Not shockingly, that became outrageously long, so I broke it into two parts. This is Part 1\u2014Part 2 is here . _______________ We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth. \u2014 Vernor Vinge What does it feel like to stand here? It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing\u2014but then you have to remember something about what it\u2019s like to stand on a time graph: you can\u2019t see what\u2019s to your right. So here\u2019s how it actually feels to stand there: Which probably feels pretty normal\u2026 _______________ The Far Future\u2014Coming Soon Imagine taking a time machine back to 1750\u2014a time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It\u2019s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone\u2019s face and chat with them even though they\u2019re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity. This experience for him wouldn\u2019t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing\u2014those words aren\u2019t big enough. He might actually die. But here\u2019s the interesting thing\u2014if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he\u2019d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t die. It would be far less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were much less different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he\u2019d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he\u2019d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750\u2014transportation, communication, etc.\u2014definitely wouldn\u2019t make him die. No, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he\u2019d have to go much farther back\u2014maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world\u2014from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species\u2014saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being \u201cinside,\u201d and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery\u2014he\u2019d likely die. And then what if, after dying, he got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he\u2019d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, \u201cOkay what\u2019s your point who cares.\u201d For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he\u2019d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time. In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they\u2019d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a \u201cdie level of progress,\u201d or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened. This pattern\u2014human progress moving quicker and quicker as time goes on\u2014is what futurist Ray Kurzweil calls human history\u2019s Law of Accelerating Returns. This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster rate than less advanced societies\u2014 because they\u2019re more advanced. 19th century humanity knew more and had better technology than 15th century humanity, so it\u2019s no surprise that humanity made far more advances in the 19th century than in the 15th century\u201415th century humanity was no match for 19th century humanity. 1 1 \u2190 open these This works on smaller scales too. The movie Back to the Future came out in 1985, and \u201cthe past\u201d took place in 1955. In the movie, when Michael J. Fox went back to 1955, he was caught off-guard by the newness of TVs, the prices of soda, the lack of love for shrill electric guitar, and the variation in slang. It was a different world, yes\u2014but if the movie were made today and the past took place in 1985, the movie could have had much more fun with much bigger differences. The character would be in a time before personal computers, internet, or cell phones\u2014today\u2019s Marty McFly, a teenager born in the late 90s, would be much more out of place in 1985 than the movie\u2019s Marty McFly was in 1955. This is for the same reason we just discussed\u2014the Law of Accelerating Returns. The average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985\u2014because the former was a more advanced world\u2014so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30. So\u2014advances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly. This suggests some pretty intense things about our future, right? Kurzweil suggests that the progress of the entire 20th century would have been achieved in only 20 years at the rate of advancement in the year 2000\u2014in other words, by 2000, the rate of progress was five times faster than the average rate of progress during the 20th century. He believes another 20th century\u2019s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that another 20th century\u2019s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century\u2019s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month. All in all, because of the Law of Accelerating Returns, Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve 1,000 times the progress of the 20th century. 2 If Kurzweil and others who agree with him are correct, then we may be as blown away by 2030 as our 1750 guy was by 2015\u2014i.e. the next DPU might only take a couple decades\u2014and the world in 2050 might be so vastly different than today\u2019s world that we would barely recognize it. This isn\u2019t science fiction. It\u2019s what many scientists smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I firmly believe\u2014and if you look at history, it\u2019s what we should logically predict. So then why, when you hear me say something like \u201cthe world 35 years from now might be totally unrecognizable,\u201d are you thinking, \u201cCool\u2026.but nahhhhhhh\u201d? Three reasons we\u2019re skeptical of outlandish forecasts of the future: 1) When it comes to history, we think in straight lines. When we imagine the progress of the next 30 years, we look back to the progress of the previous 30 as an indicator of how much will likely happen. When we think about the extent to which the world will change in the 21st century, we just take the 20th century progress and add it to the year 2000. This was the same mistake our 1750 guy made when he got someone from 1500 and expected to blow his mind as much as his own was blown going the same distance ahead. It\u2019s most intuitive for us to think linearly, when we should be thinking exponentially . If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the current rate of progress and judging based on that. They\u2019d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a much faster rate than they\u2019re moving now. 2) The trajectory of very recent history often tells a distorted story. First, even a steep exponential curve seems linear when you only look at a tiny slice of it, the same way if you look at a little segment of a huge circle up close, it looks almost like a straight line. Second, exponential growth isn\u2019t totally smooth and uniform. Kurzweil explains that progress happens in \u201cS-curves\u201d: An S is created by the wave of progress when a new paradigm sweeps the world. The curve goes through three phases: 1. Slow growth (the early phase of exponential growth) 2. Rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth) 3. A leveling off as the particular paradigm matures 3 If you look only at very recent history, the part of the S-curve you\u2019re on at the moment can obscure your perception of how fast things are advancing. The chunk of time between 1995 and 2007 saw the explosion of the internet, the introduction of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook into the public consciousness, the birth of social networking, and the introduction of cell phones and then smart phones. That was Phase 2: the growth spurt part of the S. But 2008 to 2015 has been less groundbreaking, at least on the technological front. Someone thinking about the future today might examine the last few years to gauge the current rate of advancement, but that\u2019s missing the bigger picture. In fact, a new, huge Phase 2 growth spurt might be brewing right now. 3) Our own experience makes us stubborn old men about the future. We base our ideas about the world on our personal experience, and that experience has ingrained the rate of growth of the recent past in our heads as \u201cthe way things happen.\u201d We\u2019re also limited by our imagination, which takes our experience and uses it to conjure future predictions\u2014but often, what we know simply doesn\u2019t give us the tools to think accurately about the future. 2 When we hear a prediction about the future that contradicts our experience-based notion of how things work , our instinct is that the prediction must be naive. If I tell you, later in this post, that you may live to be 150, or 250, or not die at all , your instinct will be, \u201cThat\u2019s stupid\u2014if there\u2019s one thing I know from history, it\u2019s that everybody dies.\u201d And yes, no one in the past has not died. But no one flew airplanes before airplanes were invented either. So while nahhhhh might feel right as you read this post, it\u2019s probably actually wrong. The fact is, if we\u2019re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, much more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect. Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they\u2019ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human\u2014kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what\u2019s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that\u2019s coming next. _______________ The Road to Superintelligence What Is AI? If you\u2019re like me, you used to think Artificial Intelligence was a silly sci-fi concept, but lately you\u2019ve been hearing it mentioned by serious people, and you don\u2019t really quite get it. There are three reasons a lot of people are confused about the term AI: 1) We associate AI with movies. Star Wars. Terminator. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even the Jetsons. And those are fiction, as are the robot characters. So it makes AI sound a little fictional to us. 2) AI is a broad topic. It ranges from your phone\u2019s calculator to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically. AI refers to all of these things, which is confusing. 3) We use AI all the time in our daily lives, but we often don\u2019t realize it\u2019s AI. John McCarthy, who coined the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in 1956, complained that \u201cas soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.\u201d 4 Because of this phenomenon, AI often sounds like a mythical future prediction more than a reality. At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition. Ray Kurzweil says he hears people say that AI withered in the 1980s, which he compares to \u201cinsisting that the Internet died in the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.\u201d 5 So let\u2019s clear things up. First, stop thinking of robots . A robot is a container for AI, sometimes mimicking the human form, sometimes not\u2014but the AI itself is the computer inside the robot. AI is the brain, and the robot is its body\u2014if it even has a body. For example, the software and data behind Siri is AI, the woman\u2019s voice we hear is a personification of that AI, and there\u2019s no robot involved at all. Secondly, you\u2019ve probably heard the term \u201csingularity\u201d or \u201ctechnological singularity.\u201d This term has been used in math to describe an asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply. It\u2019s been used in physics to describe a phenomenon like an infinitely small, dense black hole or the point we were all squished into right before the Big Bang. Again, situations where the usual rules don\u2019t apply. In 1993, Vernor Vinge wrote a famous essay in which he applied the term to the moment in the future when our technology\u2019s intelligence exceeds our own\u2014a moment for him when life as we know it will be forever changed and normal rules will no longer apply. Ray Kurzweil then muddled things a bit by defining the singularity as the time when the Law of Accelerating Returns has reached such an extreme pace that technological progress is happening at a seemingly-infinite pace, and after which we\u2019ll be living in a whole new world. I found that many of today\u2019s AI thinkers have stopped using the term, and it\u2019s confusing anyway, so I won\u2019t use it much here (even though we\u2019ll be focusing on that idea throughout). Finally, while there are many different types or forms of AI since AI is a broad concept, the critical categories we need to think about are based on an AI\u2019s caliber . There are three major AI caliber categories: AI Caliber 1) Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): Sometimes referred to as Weak AI , Artificial Narrow Intelligence is AI that specializes in one area. There\u2019s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that\u2019s the only thing it does. Ask it to figure out a better way to store data on a hard drive, and it\u2019ll look at you blankly. AI Caliber 2) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Sometimes referred to as Strong AI , or Human-Level AI , Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human across the board\u2014 a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Creating AGI is a much harder task than creating ANI, and we\u2019re yet to do it. Professor Linda Gottfredson describes intelligence as \u201ca very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.\u201d AGI would be able to do all of those things as easily as you can. AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as \u201can intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.\u201d Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that\u2019s just a little smarter than a human to one that\u2019s trillions of times smarter\u2014across the board. ASI is the reason the topic of AI is such a spicy meatball and why the words \u201cimmortality\u201d and \u201cextinction\u201d will both appear in these posts multiple times. As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI\u2014ANI\u2014in many ways, and it\u2019s everywhere. The AI Revolution is the road from ANI, through AGI, to ASI\u2014a road we may or may not survive but that, either way, will change everything. Let\u2019s take a close look at what the leading thinkers in the field believe this road looks like and why this revolution might happen way sooner than you might think: Where We Are Currently\u2014A World Running on ANI Artificial Narrow Intelligence is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a specific thing. A few examples: Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes should kick in to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems. Google\u2019s self-driving car , which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it. Your phone is a little ANI factory. When you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow\u2019s weather, talk to Siri, or dozens of other everyday activities, you\u2019re using ANI. Your email spam filter is a classic type of ANI\u2014it starts off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what\u2019s spam and what\u2019s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to you as it gets experience with your particular preferences. The Nest Thermostat does the same thing as it starts to figure out your typical routine and act accordingly. You know the whole creepy thing that goes on when you search for a product on Amazon and then you see that as a \u201crecommended for you\u201d product on a different site, or when Facebook somehow knows who it makes sense for you to add as a friend? That\u2019s a network of ANI systems, working together to inform each other about who you are and what you like and then using that information to decide what to show you. Same goes for Amazon\u2019s \u201cPeople who bought this also bought\u2026\u201d thing\u2014that\u2019s an ANI system whose job it is to gather info from the behavior of millions of customers and synthesize that info to cleverly upsell you so you\u2019ll buy more things. Google Translate is another classic ANI system\u2014impressively good at one narrow task. Voice recognition is another, and there are a bunch of apps that use those two ANIs as a tag team, allowing you to speak a sentence in one language and have the phone spit out the same sentence in another. When your plane lands, it\u2019s not a human that decides which gate it should go to. Just like it\u2019s not a human that determined the price of your ticket. The world\u2019s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems. Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook\u2019s Newsfeed. And those are just in the consumer world. Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets 6 ), and in expert systems like those that help doctors make diagnoses and, most famously, IBM\u2019s Watson , who contained enough facts and understood coy Trebek-speak well enough to soundly beat the most prolific Jeopardy champions. ANI systems as they are now aren\u2019t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programmed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like knocking out a power grid, causing a harmful nuclear power plant malfunction, or triggering a financial markets disaster (like the 2010 Flash Crash when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected). But while ANI doesn\u2019t have the capability to cause an existential threat , we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that\u2019s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI. Or as Aaron Saenz sees it , our world\u2019s ANI systems \u201care like the amino acids in the early Earth\u2019s primordial ooze\u201d\u2014the inanimate stuff of life that, one unexpected day, woke up. The Road From ANI to AGI Why It\u2019s So Hard Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down\u2014all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe. What\u2019s interesting is that the hard parts of trying to build AGI (a computer as smart as humans in general , not just at one narrow specialty) are not intuitively what you\u2019d think they are. Build a computer that can multiply two ten-digit numbers in a split second\u2014incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it\u2019s a dog or a cat\u2014spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old\u2019s picture book and not just recognize the words but understand the meaning of them? Google is currently spending billions of dollars trying to do it. Hard things\u2014like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation\u2014are mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things\u2014like vision, motion, movement, and perception\u2014are insanely hard for it. Or, as computer scientist Donald Knuth puts it, \u201cAI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires \u2018thinking\u2019 but has failed to do most of what people and animals do \u2018without thinking.'\u201d 7 What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of millions of years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions. It seems effortless to you because you have perfected software in your brain for doing it. Same idea goes for why it\u2019s not that malware is dumb for not being able to figure out the slanty word recognition test when you sign up for a new account on a site\u2014it\u2019s that your brain is super impressive for being able to. On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven\u2019t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn\u2019t need to work too hard to beat us. Think about it\u2014which would you rather do, build a program that could multiply big numbers or one that could understand the essence of a B well enough that you could show it a B in any one of thousands of unpredictable fonts or handwriting and it could instantly know it was a B? One fun example\u2014when you look at this, you and a computer both can figure out that it\u2019s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating: Tied so far. But if you pick up the black and reveal the whole image\u2026 \u2026you have no problem giving a full description of the various opaque and translucent cylinders, slats, and 3-D corners, but the computer would fail miserably. It would describe what it sees\u2014a variety of two-dimensional shapes in several different shades\u2014which is actually what\u2019s there. Your brain is doing a ton of fancy shit to interpret the implied depth, shade-mixing, and room lighting the picture is trying to portray. 8 And looking at the picture below, a computer sees a two-dimensional white, black, and gray collage, while you easily see what it really is\u2014a photo of an entirely-black, 3-D rock: Credit: Matthew Lloyd And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in stagnant information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why Braveheart was great but The Patriot was terrible. Daunting. So how do we get there? First Key to Creating AGI: Increasing Computational Power One thing that definitely needs to happen for AGI to be a possibility is an increase in the power of computer hardware. If an AI system is going to be as intelligent as the brain, it\u2019ll need to equal the brain\u2019s raw computing capacity. One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second (cps) the brain could manage, and you could come to this number by figuring out the maximum cps of each structure in the brain and then adding them all together. Ray Kurzweil came up with a shortcut by taking someone\u2019s professional estimate for the cps of one structure and that structure\u2019s weight compared to that of the whole brain and then multiplying proportionally to get an estimate for the total. Sounds a little iffy, but he did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark\u2014around 10 16 , or 10 quadrillion cps. Currently, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, China\u2019s Tianhe-2 , has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps. But Tianhe-2 is also a dick, taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just 20 watts ), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet. Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level\u201410 quadrillion cps\u2014then that\u2019ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life. Moore\u2019s Law is a historically-reliable rule that the world\u2019s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil\u2019s cps/$1,000 metric, we\u2019re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph\u2019s predicted trajectory: 9 So the world\u2019s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they\u2019re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn\u2019t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain. So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we\u2019ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn\u2019t make a computer generally intelligent\u2014the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power? Second Key to Creating AGI: Making It Smart This is the icky part. The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart\u2014we\u2019re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is. But there are a bunch of far-fetched strategies out there and at some point, one of them will work. Here are the three most common strategies I came across: 1) Plagiarize the brain. This is like scientists toiling over how that kid who sits next to them in class is so smart and keeps doing so well on the tests, and even though they keep studying diligently, they can\u2019t do nearly as well as that kid, and then they finally decide \u201ck fuck it I\u2019m just gonna copy that kid\u2019s answers.\u201d It makes sense\u2014we\u2019re stumped trying to build a super-complex computer, and there happens to be a perfect prototype for one in each of our heads. The science world is working hard on reverse engineering the brain to figure out how evolution made such a rad thing\u2014 optimistic estimates say we can do this by 2030. Once we do that, we\u2019ll know all the secrets of how the brain runs so powerfully and efficiently and we can draw inspiration from it and steal its innovations. One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor \u201cneurons,\u201d connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing\u2014like an infant brain. The way it \u201clearns\u201d is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it\u2019s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it\u2019s told it was wrong, those pathways\u2019 connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we\u2019re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry. More extreme plagiarism involves a strategy called \u201cwhole brain emulation,\u201d where the goal is to slice a real brain into thin layers, scan each one, use software to assemble an accurate reconstructed 3-D model, and then implement the model on a powerful computer. We\u2019d then have a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of\u2014it would just need to learn and gather information. If engineers get really good, they\u2019d be able to emulate a real brain with such exact accuracy that the brain\u2019s full personality and memory would be intact once the brain architecture has been uploaded to a computer. If the brain belonged to Jim right before he passed away, the computer would now wake up as Jim ( ? ), which would be a robust human-level AGI, and we could now work on turning Jim into an unimaginably smart ASI, which he\u2019d probably be really excited about. How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we\u2019ve not yet just recently been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress\u2014now that we\u2019ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible. 2) Try to make evolution do what it did before but for us this time. So if we decide the smart kid\u2019s test is too hard to copy, we can try to copy the way he studies for the tests instead. Here\u2019s something we know. Building a computer as powerful as the brain is possible\u2014our own brain\u2019s evolution is proof. And if the brain is just too complex for us to emulate, we could try to emulate evolution instead. The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird\u2019s wing-flapping motions\u2014often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly. So how can we simulate evolution to build AGI? The method, called \u201cgenetic algorithms,\u201d would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures \u201cperform\u201d by living life and are \u201cevaluated\u201d by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be bred with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own. The downside of copying evolution is that evolution likes to take a billion years to do things and we want to do this in a few decades. But we have a lot of advantages over evolution. First, evolution has no foresight and works randomly\u2014it produces more unhelpful mutations than helpful ones, but we would control the process so it would only be driven by beneficial glitches and targeted tweaks. Secondly, evolution doesn\u2019t aim for anything, including intelligence\u2014sometimes an environment might even select against higher intelligence (since it uses a lot of energy). We, on the other hand, could specifically direct this evolutionary process toward increasing intelligence. Third, to select for intelligence, evolution has to innovate in a bunch of other ways to facilitate intelligence\u2014like revamping the ways cells produce energy\u2014when we can remove those extra burdens and use things like electricity. It\u2019s no doubt we\u2019d be much, much faster than evolution\u2014but it\u2019s still not clear whether we\u2019ll be able to improve upon evolution enough to make this a viable strategy. 3) Make this whole thing the computer\u2019s problem, not ours. This is when scientists get desperate and try to program the test to take itself. But it might be the most promising method we have. The idea is that we\u2019d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself\u2014allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own architecture . We\u2019d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job\u2014figuring out how to make themselves smarter. More on this later. All of This Could Happen Soon Rapid advancements in hardware and innovative experimentation with software are happening simultaneously, and AGI could creep up on us quickly and unexpectedly for two main reasons: 1) Exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail\u2019s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards\u2014this GIF illustrates this concept nicely: Source 2) When it comes to software, progress can seem slow, but then one epiphany can instantly change the rate of advancement (kind of like the way science, during the time humans thought the universe was geocentric, was having difficulty calculating how the universe worked, but then the discovery that it was heliocentric suddenly made everything much easier). Or, when it comes to something like a computer that improves itself, we might seem far away but actually be just one tweak of the system away from having it become 1,000 times more effective and zooming upward to human-level intelligence. The Road From AGI to ASI At some point, we\u2019ll have achieved AGI\u2014computers with human-level general intelligence. Just a bunch of people and computers living together in equality. Oh actually not at all. The thing is, AGI with an identical level of intelligence and computational capacity as a human would still have significant advantages over humans. Like: Hardware: Speed. The brain\u2019s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today\u2019s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster than our neurons. And the brain\u2019s internal communications, which can move at about 120 m/s, are horribly outmatched by a computer\u2019s ability to communicate optically at the speed of light. Size and storage. The brain is locked into its size by the shape of our skulls, and it couldn\u2019t get much bigger anyway, or the 120 m/s internal communications would take too long to get from one brain structure to another. Computers can expand to any physical size, allowing far more hardware to be put to work, a much larger working memory (RAM), and a longterm memory (hard drive storage) that has both far greater capacity and precision than our own. Reliability and durability. It\u2019s not only the memories of a computer that would be more precise. Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they\u2019re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7. Software: Editability, upgradability, and a wider breadth of possibility. Unlike the human brain, computer software can receive updates and fixes and can be easily experimented on. The upgrades could also span to areas where human brains are weak. Human vision software is superbly advanced, while its complex engineering capability is pretty low-grade. Computers could match the human on vision software but could also become equally optimized in engineering and any other area. Collective capability. Humans crush all other species at building a vast collective intelligence. Beginning with the development of language and the forming of large, dense communities, advancing through the inventions of writing and printing, and now intensified through tools like the internet, humanity\u2019s collective intelligence is one of the major reasons we\u2019ve been able to get so far ahead of all other species. And computers will be way better at it than we are. A worldwide network of AI running a particular program could regularly sync with itself so that anything any one computer learned would be instantly uploaded to all other computers. The group could also take on one goal as a unit, because there wouldn\u2019t necessarily be dissenting opinions and motivations and self-interest, like we have within the human population. 10 AI, which will likely get to AGI by being programmed to self-improve, wouldn\u2019t see \u201chuman-level intelligence\u201d as some important milestone\u2014it\u2019s only a relevant marker from our point of view\u2014and wouldn\u2019t have any reason to \u201cstop\u201d at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it\u2019s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence. This may shock the shit out of us when it happens. The reason is that from our perspective, A) while the intelligence of different kinds of animals varies, the main characteristic we\u2019re aware of about any animal\u2019s intelligence is that it\u2019s far lower than ours, and B) we view the smartest humans as WAY smarter than the dumbest humans. Kind of like this: So as AI zooms upward in intelligence toward us, we\u2019ll see it as simply becoming smarter, for an animal. Then, when it hits the lowest capacity of humanity\u2014Nick Bostrom uses the term \u201cthe village idiot\u201d\u2014we\u2019ll be like, \u201cOh wow, it\u2019s like a dumb human. Cute!\u201d The only thing is, in the grand spectrum of intelligence, all humans, from the village idiot to Einstein, are within a very small range\u2014so just after hitting village idiot level and being declared to be AGI, it\u2019ll suddenly be smarter than Einstein and we won\u2019t know what hit us: And what happens\u2026after that? An Intelligence Explosion I hope you enjoyed normal time, because this is when this topic gets unnormal and scary, and it\u2019s gonna stay that way from here forward. I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I\u2019m going to say is real\u2014real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists. Just keep remembering that. Anyway, as I said above, most of our current models for getting to AGI involve the AI getting there by self-improvement. And once it gets to AGI, even systems that formed and grew through methods that didn\u2019t involve self-improvement would now be smart enough to begin self-improving if they wanted to. 3 And here\u2019s where we get to an intense concept: recursive self-improvement. It works like this\u2014 An AI system at a certain level\u2014let\u2019s say human village idiot\u2014is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence. Once it does, it\u2019s smarter\u2014 maybe at this point it\u2019s at Einstein\u2019s level\u2014so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps. These leaps make it much smarter than any human, allowing it to make even bigger leaps. As the leaps grow larger and happen more rapidly, the AGI soars upwards in intelligence and soon reaches the superintelligent level of an ASI system. This is called an Intelligence Explosion, 11 and it\u2019s the ultimate example of The Law of Accelerating Returns. There is some debate about how soon AI will reach human-level general intelligence. The median year on a survey of hundreds of scientists about when they believed we\u2019d be more likely than not to have reached AGI was 2040 12 \u2014that\u2019s only 25 years from now, which doesn\u2019t sound that huge until you consider that many of the thinkers in this field think it\u2019s likely that the progression from AGI to ASI happens very quickly. Like\u2014this could happen: It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times more intelligent than a human. Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ\u2014we don\u2019t have a word for an IQ of 12,952. What we do know is that humans\u2019 utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: with intelligence comes power. Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim\u2014 and this might happen in the next few decades. If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time\u2014everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth\u2014all suddenly possible. Also possible is the immediate end of all life on Earth. As far as we\u2019re concerned, if an ASI comes to being, there is now an omnipotent God on Earth\u2014and the all-important question for us is: Will it be a nice God?

Buy it here. (Or see a preview .) ___________ Everyone feels something when they\u2019re in a really good starry place on a really good starry night and they look up and see this: Some people stick with the traditional, feeling struck by the epic beauty or blown away by the insane scale of the universe. Personally, I go for the old \u201cexistential meltdown followed by acting weird for the next half hour.\u201d But everyone feels something . Physicist Enrico Fermi felt something too\u2014\u201dWhere is everybody?\u201d ________________ A really starry sky seems vast \u2014but all we\u2019re looking at is our very local neighborhood. On the very best nights, we can see up to about 2,500 stars (roughly one hundred-millionth of the stars in our galaxy), and almost all of them are less than 1,000 light years away from us (or 1% of the diameter of the Milky Way). So what we\u2019re really looking at is this: Galaxy image: Nick Risinger When confronted with the topic of stars and galaxies, a question that tantalizes most humans is, \u201cIs there other intelligent life out there?\u201d Let\u2019s put some numbers to it\u2014 As many stars as there are in our galaxy (100 \u2013 400 billion), there are roughly an equal number of galaxies in the observable universe\u2014so for every star in the colossal Milky Way, there\u2019s a whole galaxy out there. All together, that comes out to the typically quoted range of between 10 22 and 10 24 total stars , which means that for every grain of sand on every beach on Earth, there are 10,000 stars out there. The science world isn\u2019t in total agreement about what percentage of those stars are \u201csun-like\u201d (similar in size, temperature, and luminosity)\u2014opinions typically range from 5% to 20%. Going with the most conservative side of that (5%), and the lower end for the number of total stars (10 22 ), gives us 500 quintillion, or 500 billion billion sun-like stars. There\u2019s also a debate over what percentage of those sun-like stars might be orbited by an Earth-like planet (one with similar temperature conditions that could have liquid water and potentially support life similar to that on Earth). Some say it\u2019s as high as 50%, but let\u2019s go with the more conservative 22% that came out of a recent PNAS study . That suggests that there\u2019s a potentially-habitable Earth-like planet orbiting at least 1% of the total stars in the universe\u2014a total of 100 billion billion Earth-like planets. So there are 100 Earth-like planets for every grain of sand in the world. Think about that next time you\u2019re on the beach. Moving forward, we have no choice but to get completely speculative. Let\u2019s imagine that after billions of years in existence, 1% of Earth-like planets develop life (if that\u2019s true, every grain of sand would represent one planet with life on it). And imagine that on 1% of those planets, the life advances to an intelligent level like it did here on Earth. That would mean there were 10 quadrillion, or 10 million billion intelligent civilizations in the observable universe. Moving back to just our galaxy, and doing the same math on the lowest estimate for stars in the Milky Way (100 billion), we\u2019d estimate that there are 1 billion Earth-like planets and 100,000 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy. 1 SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) is an organization dedicated to listening for signals from other intelligent life. If we\u2019re right that there are 100,000 or more intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, and even a fraction of them are sending out radio waves or laser beams or other modes of attempting to contact others, shouldn\u2019t SETI\u2019s satellite dish array pick up all kinds of signals? But it hasn\u2019t. Not one. Ever. Where is everybody? It gets stranger. Our sun is relatively young in the lifespan of the universe. There are far older stars with far older Earth-like planets, which should in theory mean civilizations far more advanced than our own. As an example, let\u2019s compare our 4.54-billion-year-old Earth to a hypothetical 8-billion-year-old Planet X. If Planet X has a similar story to Earth, let\u2019s look at where their civilization would be today (using the orange timespan as a reference to show how huge the green timespan is): The technology and knowledge of a civilization only 1,000 years ahead of us could be as shocking to us as our world would be to a medieval person. A civilization 1 million years ahead of us might be as incomprehensible to us as human culture is to chimpanzees. And Planet X is 3.4 billion years ahead of us\u2026 There\u2019s something called The Kardashev Scale , which helps us group intelligent civilizations into three broad categories by the amount of energy they use: A Type I Civilization has the ability to use all of the energy on their planet . We\u2019re not quite a Type I Civilization, but we\u2019re close (Carl Sagan created a formula for this scale which puts us at a Type 0.7 Civilization). A Type II Civilization can harness all of the energy of their host star . Our feeble Type I brains can hardly imagine how someone would do this, but we\u2019ve tried our best, imagining things like a Dyson Sphere . A Type III Civilization blows the other two away, accessing power comparable to that of the entire Milky Way galaxy . If this level of advancement sounds hard to believe, remember Planet X above and their 3.4 billion years of further development. If a civilization on Planet X were similar to ours and were able to survive all the way to Type III level, the natural thought is that they\u2019d probably have mastered inter-stellar travel by now, possibly even colonizing the entire galaxy. One hypothesis as to how galactic colonization could happen is by creating machinery that can travel to other planets, spend 500 years or so self-replicating using the raw materials on their new planet, and then send two replicas off to do the same thing. Even without traveling anywhere near the speed of light, this process would colonize the whole galaxy in 3.75 million years, a relative blink of an eye when talking in the scale of billions of years: Source: Scientific American: \u201cWhere Are They\u201d Continuing to speculate, if 1% of intelligent life survives long enough to become a potentially galaxy-colonizing Type III Civilization, our calculations above suggest that there should be at least 1,000 Type III Civilizations in our galaxy alone\u2014and given the power of such a civilization, their presence would likely be pretty noticeable. And yet, we see nothing, hear nothing, and we\u2019re visited by no one. So where is everybody? _____________________ Welcome to the Fermi Paradox. We have no answer to the Fermi Paradox\u2014the best we can do is \u201cpossible explanations.\u201d And if you ask ten different scientists what their hunch is about the correct one, you\u2019ll get ten different answers. You know when you hear about humans of the past debating whether the Earth was round or if the sun revolved around the Earth or thinking that lightning happened because of Zeus, and they seem so primitive and in the dark? That\u2019s about where we are with this topic. In taking a look at some of the most-discussed possible explanations for the Fermi Paradox, let\u2019s divide them into two broad categories\u2014those explanations which assume that there\u2019s no sign of Type II and Type III Civilizations because there are none of them out there, and those which assume they\u2019re out there and we\u2019re not seeing or hearing anything for other reasons. Explanation Group 1: There are no signs of higher (Type II and III) civilizations because there are no higher civilizations in existence. Those who subscribe to Group 1 explanations point to something called the non-exclusivity problem, which rebuffs any theory that says, \u201cThere are higher civilizations, but none of them have made any kind of contact with us because they all _____.\u201d Group 1 people look at the math, which says there should be so many thousands (or millions) of higher civilizations, that at least one of them would be an exception to the rule. Even if a theory held for 99.99% of higher civilizations, the other .01% would behave differently and we\u2019d become aware of their existence. Therefore, say Group 1 explanations, it must be that there are no super-advanced civilizations. And since the math suggests that there are thousands of them just in our own galaxy, something else must be going on . This something else is called The Great Filter. The Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III intelligence, there\u2019s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit. There\u2019s some stage in that long evolutionary process that is extremely unlikely or impossible for life to get beyond. That stage is The Great Filter. If this theory is true, the big question is, Where in the timeline does the Great Filter occur? It turns out that when it comes to the fate of humankind, this question is very important. Depending on where The Great Filter occurs, we\u2019re left with three possible realities: We\u2019re rare, we\u2019re first, or we\u2019re fucked. 1. We\u2019re Rare (The Great Filter is Behind Us) One hope we have is that The Great Filter is behind us\u2014we managed to surpass it, which would mean it\u2019s extremely rare for life to make it to our level of intelligence. The diagram below shows only two species making it past, and we\u2019re one of them. This scenario would explain why there are no Type III Civilizations\u2026but it would also mean that we could be one of the few exceptions now that we\u2019ve made it this far. It would mean we have hope. On the surface, this sounds a bit like people 500 years ago suggesting that the Earth is the center of the universe\u2014it implies that we\u2019re special . However, something scientists call \u201cobservation selection effect\u201d suggests that anyone who is pondering their own rarity is inherently part of an intelligent life \u201csuccess story\u201d\u2014and whether they\u2019re actually rare or quite common, the thoughts they ponder and conclusions they draw will be identical. This forces us to admit that being special is at least a possibility. And if we are special, when exactly did we become special\u2014i.e. which step did we surpass that almost everyone else gets stuck on? One possibility: The Great Filter could be at the very beginning\u2014it might be incredibly unusual for life to begin at all. This is a candidate because it took about a billion years of Earth\u2019s existence to finally happen, and because we have tried extensively to replicate that event in labs and have never been able to do it. If this is indeed The Great Filter, it would mean that not only is there no intelligent life out there, there may be no other life at all. Another possibility: The Great Filter could be the jump from the simple prokaryote cell to the complex eukaryote cell. After prokaryotes came into being, they remained that way for almost two billion years before making the evolutionary jump to being complex and having a nucleus. If this is The Great Filter, it would mean the universe is teeming with simple prokaryote cells and almost nothing beyond that. There are a number of other possibilities\u2014some even think the most recent leap we\u2019ve made to our current intelligence is a Great Filter candidate. While the leap from semi-intelligent life (chimps) to intelligent life (humans) doesn\u2019t at first seem like a miraculous step, Steven Pinker rejects the idea of an inevitable \u201cclimb upward\u201d of evolution: \u201cSince evolution does not strive for a goal but just happens, it uses the adaptation most useful for a given ecological niche, and the fact that, on Earth, this led to technological intelligence only once so far may suggest that this outcome of natural selection is rare and hence by no means a certain development of the evolution of a tree of life.\u201d Most leaps do not qualify as Great Filter candidates. Any possible Great Filter must be one-in-a-billion type thing where one or more total freak occurrences need to happen to provide a crazy exception\u2014for that reason, something like the jump from single-cell to multi-cellular life is ruled out, because it has occurred as many as 46 times , in isolated incidents, just on this planet alone. For the same reason, if we were to find a fossilized eukaryote cell on Mars, it would rule the above \u201csimple-to-complex cell\u201d leap out as a possible Great Filter (as well as anything before that point on the evolutionary chain)\u2014because if it happened on both Earth and Mars, it\u2019s almost definitely not a one-in-a-billion freak occurrence. If we are indeed rare, it could be because of a fluky biological event, but it also could be attributed to what is called the Rare Earth Hypothesis , which suggests that though there may be many Earth- like planets, the particular conditions on Earth\u2014whether related to the specifics of this solar system, its relationship with the moon (a moon that large is unusual for such a small planet and contributes to our particular weather and ocean conditions), or something about the planet itself\u2014are exceptionally friendly to life. 2. We\u2019re the First For Group 1 Thinkers, if the Great Filter is not behind us, the one hope we have is that conditions in the universe are just recently, for the first time since the Big Bang, reaching a place that would allow intelligent life to develop. In that case, we and many other species may be on our way to super-intelligence, and it simply hasn\u2019t happened yet. We happen to be here at the right time to become one of the first super-intelligent civilizations. One example of a phenomenon that could make this realistic is the prevalence of gamma-ray bursts, insanely huge explosions that we\u2019ve observed in distant galaxies. In the same way that it took the early Earth a few hundred million years before the asteroids and volcanoes died down and life became possible, it could be that the first chunk of the universe\u2019s existence was full of cataclysmic events like gamma-ray bursts that would incinerate everything nearby from time to time and prevent any life from developing past a certain stage. Now, perhaps, we\u2019re in the midst of an astrobiological phase transition and this is the first time any life has been able to evolve for this long, uninterrupted. 3. We\u2019re Fucked (The Great Filter is Ahead of Us) If we\u2019re neither rare nor early, Group 1 thinkers conclude that The Great Filter must be in our future. This would suggest that life regularly evolves to where we are, but that something prevents life from going much further and reaching high intelligence in almost all cases\u2014and we\u2019re unlikely to be an exception. One possible future Great Filter is a regularly-occurring cataclysmic natural event, like the above-mentioned gamma-ray bursts, except they\u2019re unfortunately not done yet and it\u2019s just a matter of time before all life on Earth is suddenly wiped out by one. Another candidate is the possible inevitability that nearly all intelligent civilizations end up destroying themselves once a certain level of technology is reached. This is why Oxford University philosopher Nick Bostrom says that \u201cno news is good news.\u201d The discovery of even simple life on Mars would be devastating, because it would cut out a number of potential Great Filters behind us. And if we were to find fossilized complex life on Mars, Bostrom says \u201cit would be by far the worst news ever printed on a newspaper cover,\u201d because it would mean The Great Filter is almost definitely ahead of us\u2014ultimately dooming the species. Bostrom believes that when it comes to The Fermi Paradox, \u201cthe silence of the night sky is golden.\u201d Explanation Group 2: Type II and III intelligent civilizations are out there\u2014and there are logical reasons why we might not have heard from them. Group 2 explanations get rid of any notion that we\u2019re rare or special or the first at anything\u2014on the contrary, they believe in the Mediocrity Principle , whose starting point is that there is nothing unusual or rare about our galaxy, solar system, planet, or level of intelligence, until evidence proves otherwise. They\u2019re also much less quick to assume that the lack of evidence of higher intelligence beings is evidence of their nonexistence\u2014emphasizing the fact that our search for signals stretches only about 100 light years away from us (0.1% across the galaxy) and suggesting a number of possible explanations. Here are 10: Possibility 1) Super-intelligent life could very well have already visited Earth, but before we were here. In the scheme of things, sentient humans have only been around for about 50,000 years, a little blip of time. If contact happened before then, it might have made some ducks flip out and run into the water and that\u2019s it. Further, recorded history only goes back 5,500 years\u2014a group of ancient hunter-gatherer tribes may have experienced some crazy alien shit, but they had no good way to tell anyone in the future about it. Possibility 2) The galaxy has been colonized, but we just live in some desolate rural area of the galaxy. The Americas may have been colonized by Europeans long before anyone in a small Inuit tribe in far northern Canada realized it had happened. There could be an urbanization component to the interstellar dwellings of higher species, in which all the neighboring solar systems in a certain area are colonized and in communication, and it would be impractical and purposeless for anyone to deal with coming all the way out to the random part of the spiral where we live. Possibility 3) The entire concept of physical colonization is a hilariously backward concept to a more advanced species. Remember the picture of the Type II Civilization above with the sphere around their star? With all that energy, they might have created a perfect environment for themselves that satisfies their every need. They might have crazy-advanced ways of reducing their need for resources and zero interest in leaving their happy utopia to explore the cold, empty, undeveloped universe. An even more advanced civilization might view the entire physical world as a horribly primitive place, having long ago conquered their own biology and uploaded their brains to a virtual reality, eternal-life paradise. Living in the physical world of biology, mortality, wants, and needs might seem to them the way we view primitive ocean species living in the frigid, dark sea. FYI, thinking about another life form having bested mortality makes me incredibly jealous and upset. Possibility 4) There are scary predator civilizations out there, and most intelligent life knows better than to broadcast any outgoing signals and advertise their location. This is an unpleasant concept and would help explain the lack of any signals being received by the SETI satellites. It also means that we might be the super naive newbies who are being unbelievably stupid and risky by ever broadcasting outward signals. There\u2019s a debate going on currently about whether we should engage in METI (Messaging to Extraterrestrial Intelligence\u2014the reverse of SETI) or not, and most people say we should not. Stephen Hawking warns, \u201cIf aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn\u2019t turn out well for the Native Americans.\u201d Even Carl Sagan (a general believer that any civilization advanced enough for interstellar travel would be altruistic, not hostile) called the practice of METI \u201cdeeply unwise and immature,\u201d and recommended that \u201cthe newest children in a strange and uncertain cosmos should listen quietly for a long time, patiently learning about the universe and comparing notes, before shouting into an unknown jungle that we do not understand.\u201d Scary. 1 Possibility 5) There\u2019s only one instance of higher-intelligent life\u2014a \u201csuperpredator\u201d civilization (like humans are here on Earth)\u2014that is far more advanced than everyone else and keeps it that way by exterminating any intelligent civilization once they get past a certain level. This would suck. The way it might work is that it\u2019s an inefficient use of resources to exterminate all emerging intelligences, maybe because most die out on their own. But past a certain point, the super beings make their move\u2014because to them, an emerging intelligent species becomes like a virus as it starts to grow and spread. This theory suggests that whoever was the first in the galaxy to reach intelligence won, and now no one else has a chance. This would explain the lack of activity out there because it would keep the number of super-intelligent civilizations to just one. Possibility 6) There\u2019s plenty of activity and noise out there, but our technology is too primitive and we\u2019re listening for the wrong things. Like walking into a modern-day office building, turning on a walkie-talkie, and when you hear no activity (which of course you wouldn\u2019t hear because everyone\u2019s texting, not using walkie-talkies), determining that the building must be empty. Or maybe, as Carl Sagan has pointed out, it could be that our minds work exponentially faster or slower than another form of intelligence out there\u2014e.g. it takes them 12 years to say \u201cHello,\u201d and when we hear that communication, it just sounds like white noise to us. Possibility 7) We are receiving contact from other intelligent life, but the government is hiding it. The more I learn about the topic, the more t his seems like an idiotic theory, but I had to mention it because it\u2019s talked about so much. Possibility 8) Higher civilizations are aware of us and observing us (AKA the \u201cZoo Hypothesis\u201d). As far as we know, super-intelligent civilizations exist in a tightly-regulated galaxy, and our Earth is treated like part of a vast and protected national park, with a strict \u201cLook but don\u2019t touch\u201d rule for planets like ours. We wouldn\u2019t notice them, because i f a far smarter species wanted to observe us , it would know how to easi ly do so without us realizing it . Maybe there\u2019s a rule similar to the Star Trek\u2019s \u201cPrime Directive\u201d which prohibits super-intelligent beings from making any open contact with lesser species like us or revealing themselves in any way, until the lesser species has reached a certain level of intelligence. Possibility 9) Higher civilizations are here, all around us. But we\u2019re too primitive to perceive them. Michio Kaku sums it up like this: Let\u2019s say we have an anthill in the middle of the forest. And right next to the anthill, they\u2019re building a ten-lane super-highway. And the question is \u201cWould the ants be able to understand what a ten-lane super-highway is? Would the ants be able to understand the technology and the intentions of the beings building the highway next to them?\u201d So it\u2019s not that we can\u2019t pick up the signals from Planet X using our technology, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t even comprehend what the beings from Planet X are or what they\u2019re trying to do. It\u2019s so beyond us that even if they really wanted to enlighten us, it would be like trying to teach ants about the internet. Along those lines, this may also be an answer to \u201cWell if there are so many fancy Type III Civilizations, why haven\u2019t they contacted us yet?\u201d To answer that, let\u2019s ask ourselves\u2014when Pizarro made his way into Peru, did he stop for a while at an anthill to try to communicate? Was he magnanimous, trying to help the ants in the anthill? Did he become hostile and slow his original mission down in order to smash the anthill apart? Or was the anthill of complete and utter and eternal irrelevance to Pizarro? That might be our situation here. Possibility 10) We\u2019re completely wrong about our reality . There are a lot of ways we could just be totally off with everything we think. The universe might appear one way and be something else entirely, like a hologram . Or maybe we\u2019re the aliens and we were planted here as an experiment or as a form of fertilizer. There\u2019s even a chance that we\u2019re all part of a computer simulation by some researcher from another world, and other forms of life simply weren\u2019t programmed into the simulation. ________________ As we continue along with our possibly-futile search for extraterrestrial intelligence, I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m rooting for. Frankly, learning either that we\u2019re officially alone in the universe or that we\u2019re officially joined by others would be creepy, which is a theme with all of the surreal storylines listed above\u2014 whatever the truth actually is, it\u2019s mindblowing. Beyond its shocking science fiction component, The Fermi Paradox also leaves me with a deep humbling. No t just the normal \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m microscopic and my existence lasts for three seconds\u201d humbling that the universe always triggers. The Fermi Paradox brings out a sharper, more personal humbling, one that can only happen after spending hours of research hearing your species\u2019 most renowned scientists present insane theories, change their minds again and again, and wildly contradict each other\u2014reminding us that future generations will look at us the same way we see the ancient people who were sure that the stars were the underside of the dome of heaven, and they\u2019ll think \u201cWow they really had no idea what was going on.\u201d Compounding all of this is the blow to our species\u2019 self-esteem that comes with all of this talk about Type II and III Civilizations. Here on Earth, we\u2019re the king of our little castle, proud ruler of the huge group of imbeciles who share the planet with us. And in this bubble with no competition and no one to judge us, it\u2019s rare that we\u2019re ever confronted with the concept of being a dramatically inferior species to anyone. But after spending a lot of time with Type II and III Civilizations over the past week, our power and pride are seeming a bit David Brent-esque. That said, given that my normal outlook is that humanity is a lonely orphan on a tiny rock in the middle of a desolate universe, the humbling fact that we\u2019re probably not as smart as we think we are, and the possibility that a lot of what we\u2019re sure about might be wrong, sounds wonderful. It opens the door just a crack that maybe, just maybe , there might be more to the story than we realize.

For an explanation of why this series is happening and how Musk is involved, start with Part 1 . Pre-Post Note: I started working on this post ten weeks ago. When I started, I never intended for it to become such an ordeal. But like the Tesla post , I decided as I researched that this was A) a supremely important topic that will only become more important in the years to come, and B) something most people don\u2019t know nearly enough about. My weeks of research and discussions with Musk and others built me an in-depth, tree-trunk understanding of what\u2019s happening in what I\u2019m calling The Story of Humans and Space\u2014one that has totally reframed my mental picture of the future (yet again). And as I planned out what to include in the post, I wanted to make sure every Wait But Why reader ended up with the same foundation moving forward\u2014because with everything that\u2019s coming, we\u2019re gonna need it. So like the Tesla post, this post became a full situation. Even the progress updates leading up to its publication became a full situation. About the post itself: There are three main parts. Part 1 provides the context and background, Part 2 explores the \u201cWhy\u201d part of colonizing Mars, and Part 3 digs into the \u201cHow.\u201d To make reading this post as accessible as possible, it\u2019s broken into five pages, each about the length of a normal WBW post, and you can jump to any part of the post easily by clicking the links in the Table of Contents below. We\u2019re also trying two new things: 1) PDF and ebook options: We made a fancy PDF of this post for printing and offline viewing, and an ebook containing the whole four-part Elon Musk series: 2) An audio version . You can find an unabridged audio version of the post, read by me, as well as a discussion about the post between Andrew and me here . ___________ Contents Part 1: The Story of Humans and Space Part 2: Musk\u2019s Mission Part 3: How to Colonize Mars \u2192 Phase 1: Figure out how to put things into space \u2192 Phase 2: Revolutionize the cost of space travel \u2192 Phase 3: Colonize Mars A SpaceX Future 2365 AD, Ganymede One more day until departure. It was so surreal to picture actually being there that she still didn\u2019t really believe it would happen. All those things she had always heard about\u2014buildings that were constructed hundreds of years before the first human set foot on Ganymede; animals the size of a house; oceans the size of her whole world; tropical beaches; the famous blue sky; the giant sun that\u2019s so close it can burn your skin; and the weirdest part\u2014 no Jupiter hovering overhead . Having seen it all in so many movies, she felt like she was going to visit a legendary movie set. It was too much to think about all at once. For now, she just had to focus on making sure she had everything she needed and saying goodbye to everyone\u2014it would be a long time before she would see them again\u2026 ___________ Part 1: The Story of Humans and Space About six million years ago, a very important female great ape had two children. One of her children would go on to become the common ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other would give birth to a line that would one day include the entire human race. While the descendants of her first child would end up being pretty normal and monkey-ish, as time passed, strange things began to happen with the lineage of the other. 1 1 \u2190 click these We\u2019re not quite sure why, but over the next six million years, our ancestral line started to do something no creatures on Earth had ever done before\u2014they woke up. It happened slowly and gradually through the thousands of generations the same way your brain slowly comes to in the first few seconds after you rouse from sleep. But as the clarity increased, our ancestors started to look around and, for the very first time, wonder . Emerging from a 3.6-billion-year dream, life on Earth had its first questions. What is this big room we\u2019re in, and who put us here? What is that bright yellow circle on the ceiling and where does it go every night? Where does the ocean end and what happens when you get there? Where are all the dead people now that they\u2019re not here anymore? We had discovered our species\u2019 great mystery novel\u2014 Where Are We? \u2014and we wanted to learn how to read it. As the light of human consciousness grew brighter and brighter, we began to arrive at answers that seemed to make sense. Maybe we were on top of a floating disk, and maybe that disk was on top of a huge turtle. Maybe the pinpricks of light above us at night are a glimpse into what lies beyond this big room\u2014and maybe that\u2019s where we go when we die. Maybe if we can find the place where the ceiling meets the floor, we can poke our heads through and see all the super fun stuff on the other side. 2 Around 10,000 years ago, isolated tribes of humans began to merge together and form the first cities. In larger communities, people were able to talk to each other about this mystery novel we had found, comparing notes across tribes and through the generations. As the techniques for learning became more sophisticated and the clues piled up, new discoveries surfaced. The world was apparently a ball, not a disk. Which meant that the ceiling was actually a larger sphere surrounding us. The sizes of the other objects floating out there in the sphere with us, and the distances between them, were vaster than we had ever imagined. And then, something upsetting: The sun wasn\u2019t revolving around us. We were revolving around the sun. This was a super unwarm, unfuzzy discovery. Why the hell weren\u2019t we in the center of things? What did that mean? Where are we? The sphere was already unpleasantly big\u2014if we weren\u2019t in the center of it, were we just on a random ball inside of it, kind of for no apparent reason? Could this really be what was happening? Scary. Then things got worse. It seemed that the pinpricks of light on the edge of the sphere weren\u2019t what we thought they were\u2014they were other suns like ours. And they were out there floating just like our sun\u2014which means we weren\u2019t inside of a sphere at all . Not only was our planet not the center of things, even our sun was just a random dude out there, in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothingness. Scary. Our sun turned out to be a little piece of something much bigger. A beautiful, vast cloud of billions of suns. The everything of everything. At least we had that. Until we realized that it wasn\u2019t everything, it was this: Darkness. The better our tools and understanding became, the more we could zoom out, and the more we zoomed out, the more things sucked. We were deciphering the pages of Where Are We? at our own peril, and we had deciphered our way right into the knowledge that we\u2019re unbelievably alone, living on a lonely island inside a lonely island inside a lonely island, buried in layers of isolation, with no one to talk to. That\u2019s our situation. In the most recent 1% of our species\u2019 short existence, we have become the first life on Earth to know about the Situation\u2014and we\u2019ve been having a collective existential crisis ever since. You really can\u2019t blame us. Imagine not realizing that the universe is a thing and then realizing the universe is a thing . It\u2019s a lot to take in. Most of us handle it by living in a pleasant delusion, pretending that the only place we live is in an endless land of colors and warmth. We\u2019re like this guy, who\u2019s doing everything he possibly can to ignore the Situation: 3 And our best friend for this activity? The clear blue sky. The blue sky seems like it was invented to help humans pretend the Situation doesn\u2019t exist, serving as the perfect whimsical backdrop to shield us from reality. Then nighttime happens, and there\u2019s the Situation, staring us right in the face. Oh yeah\u2026 This la-di-da  \u2192  oh yeah\u2026  \u2192  la-di-da  \u2192  oh yeah\u2026 merry-go-round of psychosis was, for most of recent history, the extent of our relationship with the Situation. But in the last 60 years, that relationship has vaulted to a whole new level. During World War II, missile technology leapt forward, 2 and for the first time, a new, mind-blowing concept was possible\u2014 Space travel. For thousands of years, The Story of Humans and Space had been the story of staring out and wondering. The possibility of people leaving our Earth island and venturing out into space burst open the human spirit of adventure. I imagine a similar feeling in the people of the 15th century, during the Age of Discovery, when we were working our way through the world map chapter of Where Are We? and the notion of cross-ocean voyages dazzled people\u2019s imaginations. If you asked a child in 1495 what they wanted to be when they grew up, \u201can ocean explorer\u201d would probably have been a common response. In 1970, if you asked a child the same question, the answer would be, \u201can astronaut\u201d\u2014i.e. a Situation explorer . WWII advanced the possibility of human space travel, but it was in late 1957, when the Soviets launched the first man-made object into orbit, the adorable Sputnik 1 , that space travel became the defining quest of the world\u2019s great powers. At the time, the Cold War was in full throttle, and the US and Soviets had their measuring sticks out for an internationally-televised penis-measuring contest. With the successful launch of Sputnik, the Soviet penis bolted out by a few centimeters, horrifying the Americans. To the Soviets, putting a satellite into space before the US was proof that Soviet technology was superior to American technology, which in turn was put forward as proof, for all the world to see, that communism was a system superior to capitalism. Eight months later, NASA was born. The Space Race had begun, and NASA\u2019s first order of business would be to get a man into space, and then a man into full orbit, preferably both before the Soviets. The US was not to be shown up again. In 1959, NASA launched Project Mercury to carry out the mission. They were on the verge of success when in April of 1961, the Soviets launched Yuri Gagarin into a full orbit around the Earth, making the first human in space and in orbit a Soviet. It was time for drastic measures. John F. Kennedy\u2019s advisors told him that the Soviets had too big a lead for the US to beat them at any near-term achievements\u2014but that the prospect of a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to get there first. So Kennedy gave his famous \u201cwe choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hahhd\u201d speech , and directed an outrageous amount of funding at the mission ($20 billion, or $205 billion in today\u2019s dollars). The result was Project Apollo. Apollo\u2019s mission was to land an American on the moon\u2014and to do it first . The Soviets answered with Soyuz, their own moon program, and the race was on. As the early phases of Apollo started coming together, Project Mercury finally hit its stride. Just a month after Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, American astronaut Alan Shepard became the second man in space, completing a little arc that didn\u2019t put him in full orbit but allowed him to give space a high-five at the top of the arc. A few months later, in February of 1962, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. The next seven years saw 22 US and Soviet manned launches as the superpowers honed their skills and technology. By late 1968, the furiously-sprinting US had more total launches under their belt (17) than the Soviets (10), and together, the two nations had mastered what we call Low Earth Orbit (LEO). But LEO hadn\u2019t really excited anyone since the early \u201960s. Both powers had their sights firmly set on the moon. The Apollo program was making quick leaps, and in December of 1968, the US became the first nation to soar outside of LEO. Apollo 8 made it all the way to the moon\u2019s orbit and circled around 10 times before returning home safely. The crew, which included James Lovell (who a few months later played the role of Tom Hanks on the Apollo 13 mission), shattered the human altitude record and became the first people to see the moon up close, the first to see the \u201cdark\u201d side of the moon, and the first to see the Earth as a whole planet, snapping this iconic photo: 4 Upon return, the crew became America\u2019s most celebrated heroes\u2014which I hope they enjoyed for eight months. Three Apollo missions later, in July of 1969, Apollo 11 made Americans Neil Armstrong 3 and Buzz Aldrin the first humans on the moon, and Armstrong took this famous photo of Aldrin looking all puffy: 5 It\u2019s hard to fully emphasize what a big deal this was. Ever since life on Earth began 3.6 billion years ago, no earthly creature had set foot on any celestial body other than the Earth. Suddenly, there are Armstrong and Aldrin, bouncing around another sphere, looking up in the sky where the moon is supposed to be and seeing the Earth instead. Insane. Project Apollo proved to be a smashing success. Not only did Apollo get a man on the moon before the Soviets, the program sent 10 more men to the moon over the next 3.5 years on five other Apollo missions. There were six successful moon trips in seven tries, with the famous exception being Apollo 13, which was safely aborted after an explosion in the oxygen tank. 4 The Soviet Soyuz program kept running into technical problems, and it never ended up putting someone on the moon. The final Apollo moonwalk took place in late 1972. In only one decade, we had conquered nearby space, and progress was accelerating. If at that time you had asked any American, or any other human, what the coming decades of space travel would bring, they\u2019d have made big, bold predictions. Many more people on the moon, a permanent moon base, people on Mars, and beyond. So you can only imagine how surprised they\u2019d be if you told them in 1972, after just watching 12 humans walk on the moon, that 43 years later, in the impossibly futuristic-sounding year 2015, the number of people to set foot on the moon would still be 12 . Or that after leaving Low Earth Orbit in the dust years earlier and using it now as our pre-moon trip parking lot, 2015 would roll around and LEO would be the farthest out humans would ever go. 1972 people would be blown away by our smart phones and our internet, but they\u2019d be just as shocked that we gave up on pushing our boundaries in space. So what happened? After such a wildly exciting decade of human space adventure, why did we just stop? Well, like we found in the Tesla post , \u201cWhy did we stop?\u201d is the wrong question. Instead, we should ask: Why were we ever adventurous about sending humans into space in the first place? Space travel is unbelievably expensive. National budgets are incredibly tight. The fact is, it\u2019s kind of surprising that a nation ever ponied up a sizable chunk of its budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries. And that\u2019s actually because no nation did blow their budget for the sake of adventure and inspiration and pushing our boundaries\u2014two nations blew their budgets because of a penis \u2013 length contest. In the face of international embarrassment at a time when everyone was trying to figure out whose economic system was better, the US government agreed to drop the usual rules for a few years to pour whatever resources were necessary on the problem to make sure they won that argument\u2014 And once they won it, the contest was over and so were the special rules. And the US went back to spending money like a normal person. 6 Instead of continuing to push the limits at all costs, the US and the Soviets got a grip, put their pants back on, shook hands, and started working together like adults on far more practical projects, like setting up a joint space station in LEO. In the four decades since then, the Story of Humans and Space has again become confined to Earth, where we find ourselves with two primary reasons to interact with space (Note: the next whole chunk of the post is a slight diversion for an overview on satellites, space probes, and space telescopes. If that doesn\u2019t excite you, I won\u2019t be hurt if you skip down to the International Space Station section): 1) Support for Earth Industries The first and primary reason humans have interacted with space since the Apollo program isn\u2019t about human interest in space. It\u2019s about using space for practical purposes in support of industries on Earth\u2014mostly in the form of satellites. The bulk of today\u2019s rocket launches into space are simply putting things into LEO whose purpose is to look back down at Earth, not to the great expanses in the other direction. Here\u2019s a little satellite overview: Satellites Blue Box We don\u2019t think about them that often, but above us are hundreds of flying robots that play a large part in our lives on Earth. In 1957, lonely Sputnik circled the Earth by itself, but today, the worlds of communication, weather forecasting, television, navigation, and aerial photography all rely heavily on satellites, as do many national militaries and government intelligence agencies. The total market for satellite manufacturing, the launches that carry them to space, and related equipment and services has ballooned from $60 billion in 2004 to over $200 billion in 2015. Satellite industry revenue today makes up only 4% of the global telecommunications industry but accounts for over 60% of space industry revenue. 7 Here\u2019s how the world\u2019s satellites break down by role (in 2013): 8 Of the 1,265 active satellites in orbit at the beginning of 2015, the US owns by far the largest number at 528\u2014over 40% of the total\u2014but over 50 countries own at least one orbiting satellite. As for where all of these satellites are, most of them fall into two distinct \u201clayers\u201d of space: About two-thirds of active satellites are in Low Earth Orbit. LEO starts up at 99 miles (160 km) above the Earth, the lowest altitude at which an object can orbit without atmospheric drag messing things up.  The top of LEO is 1,240 miles (2,000 km) up. Typically, the lowest satellites are at around 220 miles (350 km) up or higher. Most of the rest (about one-third) of the satellites are much farther out, in a place called geostationary orbit (GEO). It\u2019s right at 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above the Earth, and it\u2019s called geostationary because something orbiting in it rotates at the exact speed that the Earth turns, making its position in the sky stationary relative to a point on the Earth. It\u2019ll seem to be motionless to an observer on the ground. 9 GEO is ideal for something like a TV satellite because a dish on the Earth can aim at the same fixed spot all the time. A small percentage of other satellites are in medium Earth orbit (MEO), which is everything in between LEO and GEO. One notable resident of MEO is the GPS system that most Americans, and people from many other countries, use every day. I never realized that the entire GPS system, a US Department of Defense project that went live in 1995, only uses 32 satellites total. And until 2012, the number was only 24\u2014six orbits, each with four satellites. But you can see in the GIF below that even with 24, a given point on the Earth can be seen by at least six of the satellites at any given time, and usually it\u2019s nine or higher (in the GIF, the blue dot on the Earth is a hypothetical person on the ground, and whichever satellites can see him at a given time are blue, with the green lines showing their line of sight to the person): 10 This is why your phone\u2019s map can still show your location even when you\u2019re somewhere with no cellular service\u2014because it has nothing to do with cellular service. The system is also set up to be redundant\u2014only four satellites need to simultaneously see you in order for the system to pinpoint your location. GPS satellites have an orbital period of about 12 hours, making two full rotations of the Earth each day. 5 You can see satellite locations using Google Earth (here\u2019s a cool video of Google Earth showing the satellites). Space Debris Bluer Box There\u2019s a big problem happening in the world of satellites. In addition to the 1,265 active satellites up in orbit, there are thousands more inactive satellites, as well as a bunch of spent rockets from previous missions. And once in a while, one of them explodes, or two of them collide, creating a ton of tiny fragments called space debris. The number of objects in space has risen quickly over recent decades, as a GIF 6 made by the ESA shows (with exaggerated-sized objects relative to the Earth\u2019s size): 11 The majority of satellites and debris are bunched around the Earth in LEO, and the outer ring of objects is what\u2019s located in GEO. Earth space agencies track about 17,000 objects in space, only 7% of which are active satellites. Here\u2019s a map showing every known object in space today. 12 But the crazy thing is they only track the large objects, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in that image. Estimates for the number of smaller debris objects (1 \u2013 10 cm) range from 150,000 to 500,000, and there are over a million total pieces of debris larger than 2 mm. 13 The issue is that at the incredible speeds at which space objects move (most LEO objects zip along at over 17,000 mph), a collision with even a tiny object can cause devastating damage to an active satellite or spacecraft. An object of only 1 cm at those speeds will cause the same damage in a collision as a small hand grenade . 7 14 Over a third of all space debris originated from just two events: China\u2019s 2007 anti-satellite test, when China shat on the world\u2019s face by intentionally blowing up one of its own satellites, creating 3,000 new pieces of debris large enough to be trackable, and a 2009 collision between two satellites that exploded into 2,000 debris chunks. 15 Each collision increases the amount of debris, which in turn increases the likelihood of more collisions, and there\u2019s danger of a domino effect situation, which scientists call the Kessler Syndrome . A bunch of parties are proposing ways to mitigate the amount of debris in LEO\u2014everything from harpooning the debris to laser blasting it to intercepting it with a cloud of gas. Here\u2019s a chart that sums up each nation\u2019s \u201cspace footprint,\u201d showing the quantity of active satellites, inactive satellites, and space debris caused by each country: 16 There are a few other space activities in the \u201cSupport for Earth Industries\u201d category of human/space interaction\u2014like space mining , space burial , and space tourism \u2014but at least for now, satellites account for almost the entire category. 2) Looking and Learning The second reason humans have interacted with space in the last four decades proves that while we may have stopped sending people into The Situation, we never lost our hunger to learn about what\u2019s out there. As society moved on from space and turned its attention elsewhere, astronomers have kept busy at work deciphering their way through page after page of the old mystery novel, Where Are We? Astronomers learn best with their eyes, and a side effect of the Space Race was the development of far better technology for seeing what\u2019s out there. There are two high-tech ways modern astronomers see things: Looking and Learning Tool #1: Sending probes around the Solar System Basically, scientists fire a fancy robot toward some distant planet, moon, or asteroid, and the robot spends months or years flying through space, bored, until it finally arrives. Then, depending on the plan, it either just flies by the object, taking some pictures on the way, orbits the object to get more detailed information, or lands on the object for a full inspection. Everything it learns, it sends back to us, and one day, when its job is done, we either kill the probe by crashing it into the object or let it just fly out into deep space to be depressed. I often use myself as a litmus test for what the public probably knows about or doesn\u2019t know about. As I\u2019ve mentioned before on this blog, I\u2019ve been seriously dating astronomy ever since I was three years old\u2014so if I don\u2019t know something going on in the world of space, I assume that most people don\u2019t. And when it comes to space probes, I\u2019ve felt pretty disoriented. Are there 200 of them flying around out there? 50? 9? Why are they out there, who sent them, and what are they doing? All I\u2019d know is that sometimes there would be a random story about some probe sending back stunning pictures\u2014I\u2019d open the cnn.com gallery, click through them, be thrilled for a second, send the link to the three friends of mine who are also dating astronomy, and then try to close the page but instead see some trashy CNN clickbait headline on the side of the page, click that, and ruin my life for the next three hateful hours. That\u2019s my relationship with humanity\u2019s space probes. But in researching this post, I quickly realized there\u2019s not that much to know, and it doesn\u2019t take too big an effort to get fully oriented. Here are what I consider the eight key space robots to know about right now: 17 1) New Horizons (Pluto, NASA) New Horizons goes first because its big moment just happened. Launched in 2006 on a decade-long trip to Pluto (sped up on its way by a Jupiter fly-by in 2007 that gravity-zinged it to a much faster speed), New Horizons finally reached Pluto on July 14th, 2015. It didn\u2019t land on Pluto, but it flew very near to it and showed us Pluto for the first time: 8 18 Next, New Horizons will be on its way further outwards into the Kuiper belt to send back images of comets and dwarf planets. You can track New Horizons\u2019 location here . Awkwardly, Pluto was still a planet when New Horizons launched, and everyone spent the years following Pluto\u2019s demotion avoiding making eye contact with the New Horizons team. While I agree with the common sentiment that it\u2019s sad that Pluto\u2019s sad about its demotion, 9 the truth is, Pluto should probably appreciate that it got away with 76 illegitimate years as a planet celebrity, pulling in a ton of Kuiper belt ass in the process, given that fellow Kuiper belt dwarf planet Eris spent that whole time living its life in total obscurity, only discovered in 2005. 2) Curiosity (Mars, NASA) Curiosity is a now-famous rover. A car-sized lovable lander robot dropped down on Mars\u2019s surface in 2012, Curiosity is studying a bunch of things inside a large crater, with its primary objective being to figure out if there\u2019s ever been life on Mars. The last two Mars rovers, Opportunity and Spirit, landed in 2004 with a planned mission of 90 days. Both lasted way past their expiry date, and Opportunity is still active. Such a good boy. There are a bunch of other probes orbiting around Mars as well, but Curiosity is the main event there. In my research, I came across this video from an IMAX movie about getting the rover Spirit from Earth to the surface of Mars and thought it was the coolest video ever. Until I found this video about getting Curiosity on Mars, which was even cooler. 3) Juno (Jupiter, NASA) Juno left Earth in 2011, made a big loop and came back to Earth in 2013 to get a gravity zing (during which it captured a cool video of the moon circling the Earth), and is now on its way to Jupiter, where it\u2019ll arrive in July of 2016. 19 Once it arrives, Juno will orbit Jupiter, taking pictures and using sensors to try to figure out what\u2019s going on in there underneath all the succulent-looking cloud tops. It\u2019ll die by falling into Jupiter, hopefully snapping and relaying some quick photos of what it looks like inside Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere before burning up so that someone can make a virtual reality video that lets you descend into Jupiter\u2019s surface. 4) Cassini (Saturn, NASA / European Space Agency / Italian Space Agency collaboration) Launched in 1997, Cassini set off towards Saturn, the only planet in the Solar System who decided it was okay to wear a tutu. Reaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini became the first probe in history to orbit the planet, sending back some jaw-dropping pictures, like this one: 20 And this one: And this close-up of the rings: And this absurdly cool picture of Saturn with the sun behind it: In 2005, Cassini dropped its attached lander, the upsettingly-named Huygens, down onto the largest of Saturn\u2019s moons, Titan. Here\u2019s a real image of the surface of Titan, taken by Huygens (it\u2019s creepily fascinating seeing the actual surface of something as far away and mysterious as a Saturn moon): 21 5 and 6) Voyager 1 and 2 (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune; NASA) Launched in 1977, the two Voyager probes were the first probes to collect images of the four outer giants of the Solar System. Voyager 2 is still the only probe to visit Uranus and Neptune, taking these eerie photos of the two, respectively: 22 The cool thing about the Voyagers is that even though their original missions are now long over, they\u2019re still zooming outward. They\u2019re both ridiculously far away now and going super fast. Voyager 1 is the faster of the two, going 38,000 mph (61,000 km/h)\u2014so fast that it would cross the Atlantic Ocean in five minutes\u2014and it\u2019s the farthest man-made object from Earth, currently 131 AU 10 away from Earth. It was also the first man-made object to leave the Solar System. At this rate, Voyager 1 will reach Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us, in about 73,000 years. Another cool thing about the Voyagers is that before they launched, a NASA committee, led by Carl Sagan, loaded them each up with a time capsule , full of symbols, sounds, and images of Earth (and symbol instructions about how to play and view the media), so the probes can one day tell aliens what our deal is. Probably a waste of everyone\u2019s time, but who knows. 7) Rosetta (comet, ESA) Launched in 2004, Rosetta got a lot of attention last year when it reached comet 67P in August 2014 and successfully dropped its little lander, Philae, onto the comet a couple months later. Comet 67P turned out to kind of just be a big rock (2.7 mi/4.3 km long), but the images taken by Rosetta were cool: 8) Dawn (Vesta and Ceres, NASA) Dawn can\u2019t believe it made the cut on this list. The reason I included it is that I\u2019m not sure people realize that there are huge, almost planet-size objects in the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt, a huge ring of millions of asteroids, including over 750,000 that are at least 1 km in diameter, 23 lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter (not to be confused with the much larger Kuiper belt that surrounds the outer Solar System). Among the many asteroids in the asteroid belt is Ceres , a dwarf planet 27% the diameter of the moon that makes up one-third of the asteroid belt\u2019s total mass, and Vesta , the second largest object in the belt after Ceres and the brightest belt object in our night sky. 11 I didn\u2019t really know Ceres and Vesta were things. Anyway, Dawn, which was launched in 2007, spent nine months orbiting Vesta in 2011 before heading off to Ceres, where it arrived in March 2015 (making it the first probe to orbit two different bodies). There\u2019s another handful of probes out there as well. Like Messenger , which orbited Mercury for seven years until intentionally crashing into it in April 2015; Akatsuki , a Japanese probe that was supposed to start orbiting Venus in 2010 but botched it, and will try again this year; a bunch of probes uneventfully circling the moon, including China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 3, which dropped the first lander on the moon since 1976; and a group of others taking measurements from the sun. Here\u2019s an exhaustive list of all past and present probes, and an awesome National Geographic visualization that sums it all up (click the graphic for a larger view): 24 Looking and Learning Tool #2: Telescopes Telescopes have been around since the early 17th century, and as they got more and more powerful over the next 400 years, they became humanity\u2019s primary tool for turning the pages of Where Are We? But there came a point when ground telescopes ran into a limit on what they\u2019d be able to see, no matter how advanced they became. You know when you look at a light through a glass of water and the light is all bendy and silly? That\u2019s what\u2019s happening when stars twinkle, except instead of water, we\u2019re looking at them through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The atmosphere doesn\u2019t distort light as much as water does, but stars and galaxies are tiny pinpricks of light in our sky, so any level of blur is a big problem\u2014it\u2019s like being underwater in a swimming pool and looking upwards, trying to examine a bunch of birds flying in the sky above. In the 1960s, humans gained the ability to put telescopes in space, where they\u2019d show us the first crystal-clear view of the stars in history. In 1990, NASA launched the first truly badass space telescope, the Hubble. 12 25 The 13-ton, school bus-length Hubble Space Telescope\u2019s 7.9 foot (2.4 m) lens is accurate enough to shine a laser beam on a dime 200 miles away and powerful enough to see a pair of fireflies in Tokyo from your home in Boston (if the Earth were flat). And in its position in orbit 340 miles above Earth, where there\u2019s no atmosphere or light pollution in the way, the Hubble is on what NASA calls \u201cthe ultimate mountaintop.\u201d 26 All of this gives the Hubble an unprecedented view of the universe, allowing it to spend the last 25 years sending us the most astounding photographs of things I can\u2019t really believe are real. Like this epic galaxy: 27 Or these two galaxies, which are in the slow process of merging: Or the inconceivably huge Pillars of Creation (the left finger is so big, at four light years from top to bottom, that if you started at the knuckle and flew in an airplane upwards, it would take 4.5 million years to get to the fingertip): Or the time Hubble aimed its lens at a tiny, seemingly empty square of the sky (seen here next to the moon to show the size of the square): And found thousands of galaxies: What Hubble and other space telescopes 13 have shown us has revealed worlds of new information about where we are and how we got here, expanding our knowledge about everything from dark energy to the origin and age and size of the universe to the number of planets out there like ours that might have life on them. For over 40 years now, those two objectives\u2014supporting Earth industries and continuing to learn and discover\u2014have been the extent of our relationship with space. And because those two goals are both best accomplished by machine space travelers, the most recent chapter of The Story of Humans and Space has been all about space faring machines, with the human role taking place on or very near Earth, controlling things with joysticks. The only reason any humans have gone to space since Apollo 17 returned to Earth in 1972 is that sometimes, the machines aren\u2019t yet advanced enough to do a certain task, so we need to send a human up to do it instead. Of the roughly 550 people who have ever been in space, over 400 of them have gone there in the post-Space Race era. But since Apollo, the reasons have been practical\u2014scientists and technicians going to space to do a job. That\u2019s why each and every manned mission of the past four decades has kept within the thin blanket of space surrounding the Earth\u2014Low Earth Orbit. The International Space Station Today, the purpose of almost every manned space mission is to take astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). 28 The ISS is an international collaboration among 16 countries, started in 1998 and constructed over the span of a decade. The space station orbits the Earth in the lowest strip of LEO at an altitude of between 205 and 255 miles (330\u2013410 km 14 ), about the distance across Iceland\u2014close enough to the ground that you can easily see it at night with your naked eye . 15 And it\u2019s bigger than people realize, weighing as much as 320 cars and spanning the full length of an American football field: 29 What the Hell Does Anyone Do in the ISS? Blue Box As I began working on this post, I realized I didn\u2019t really know what the ISS was for or what anyone did while they were there. Every time I see a video of what goes on inside the space station, it\u2019s just some adult floating around having playtime. Conveniently, there\u2019s such a thing as an ISS conference , and it happened to take place last month, in Boston. So I went. The conference was run by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space ( CASIS ), which manages the US portion of the ISS. Here\u2019s what I learned at the conference: The ISS is a science laboratory. It\u2019s kind of like other labs, except with the party trick that it\u2019s soaring through space, so it\u2019s the one lab where you can test things in zero gravity (it\u2019s not actually zero gravity\u2014it\u2019s micro gravity \u2014 something I\u2019ll explain later in the post). What most ISS experiments have in common is that they\u2019re there for the gravity situation, but beyond that, they span a wide range of purposes\u2014everything from learning about osteoporosis as astronauts\u2019 bones atrophy (because they don\u2019t have to fight against gravity), to testing how equipment holds up in space, to analyzing how fluids behave and interact without the influence of any other forces, to using the change in gravity to trick bacteria into revealing which genes make them immune to certain medicines. Astronauts in the ISS have a tight and controlled schedule during the week. At all times, they\u2019re either sleeping (8.5 hours), eating (1.5 hours for breakfast/dinner, 1 hour for lunch) exercising (mandatory 2.5 hours a day), or working on experiments (9 hours a day)\u2014I took this photo of the current schedule of the three astronauts on the ISS. 16 Weekends are off, which could not possibly sound more fun\u2014you get to spend the whole time floating around and looking out the window. I\u2019m not the only one who badly wants to play on the ISS\u2014there\u2019s a furiously competitive process to be selected by NASA to go. Thousands apply, 100 are picked for a final round interview and physical examination, and only one or two end up getting the nod. On rare occasion, a private company or individual can buy a spot on the station for a few days, but it costs around $60 million. If you want to get a better feel for what it\u2019s like to live on the ISS, here\u2019s a video tour of the space station by a floaty astronaut. So far, 216 people have gotten to play on the ISS, from 15 countries: 30 How Stuff Gets to Space We\u2019ve gone over what\u2019s in space, but how does all that stuff get to space? Have you ever asked yourself how something like the GPS satellite gets up there in the first place? The answer is that there are nine countries that have the ability to launch something into orbit: Russia, the US, France, Japan, China, India, Israel, Iran and, um, North Korea\u2014along with one non-national entity, the European Space Agency (ESA). If a satellite goes up into space, it\u2019s because someone paid one of those ten entities to bring it there atop a massive, expensive rocket (or because a country is putting one up there for its own uses). As for launching humans into space, only three countries in history have done it\u2014Russia, the US, and China (who is a fast-growing newcomer to the space industry). Since the 60s, Russia has used its Soyuz rockets to launch people into space, and the US, after wrapping up the Apollo program in 1972, regained the ability to put people in orbit in 1981 with the Space Shuttle program. 31 Over the next 30 years, the US launched 135 Space Shuttles into LEO, with 133 successes. The two exceptions are fairly traumatizing parts of American history\u2014 Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. The Space Shuttle Program retired in 2011. Today, only two countries can launch a human into orbit\u2014Russia and China. With no capability themselves, the US\u2014the country that once triumphantly put a man on the moon while the world watched\u2014now has to launch their astronauts on Russian rockets, at Russia\u2019s whim. ___________ So what are we to make of The Story of Humans and Space? It\u2019s a bit of an odd tale. In 1970, the story looked like this: So the assumption about where the story was headed was this: But now it\u2019s 2015, and it turns out that this is what was happening: When I look at what\u2019s going on with humans and space today, I should think it\u2019s incredible. Just 58 years after the Soviets put the first man-made object into orbit, we now have a swarm of high-tech equipment soaring around our planet, giving humans magical capabilities in vision and communication. There\u2019s a team of flying robot messengers spread out through the Solar System, reporting back to us with their findings. There\u2019s a huge flying telescope high above Earth, showing us exactly what the observable universe looks like. There\u2019s a football field-sized science lab 250 miles above our heads with people in it. Everything I just said is amazing . And if only The Story of Humans and Space looked like this\u2014 \u2014I would be marveling at the things we\u2019re currently doing out in The Situation. But unfortunately, the 60s happened. So instead, it\u2019s like this: A good magic show follows a simple rule\u2014make the act get better as it goes along. If you can\u2019t continue to stay a step ahead of the increasingly-jaded crowd, they\u2019ll quickly tune you out. In some areas, the Humans and Space magic show has continued steadily upward. In our quest for knowledge and understanding, for example, we continue to outdo ourselves, learning significantly more about the universe every decade. The human spirit of discovery is alive and well, having thrived in space in the years since Apollo. But as fascinated as we are by discovery\u2014as much as we yearn to know all the secrets hidden in the pages of Where Are We?\u2014 when it comes to filling us with true excitement and inspiration and getting our adrenaline pumping, discovery doesn\u2019t hold a candle to adventure. Probes and telescopes may fill us with wonder and light up our curiosity, but nothing gets us in our animal core like watching our species go where no man has gone before. And in that arena, the last four decades have left us feeling empty. After watching people land on the moon, following manned missions to and from the ISS is, as Ross Andersen said , \u201cabout as thrilling as watching Columbus sail to Ibiza.\u201d And that\u2019s why, in today\u2019s world, The Story of Humans and Space has drifted off the front page of our consciousness. The topic that should drop all of us to our knees has become a geeky sideshow. Ask 10 well-educated people you know about what\u2019s going on with Solar System probes or the ISS or NASA or SpaceX and most won\u2019t be able to tell you very much. Some won\u2019t even know that people ever go to space anymore. People don\u2019t know because people don\u2019t care. Because of the way it played out, The Story of Humans and Space feels like a disappointment. And looking at the world around us today, it\u2019s intuitive to predict that future chapters of the space story will continue to putter along as they do today: Many people don\u2019t think this is a bad thing. \u201cWhy spend exorbitant amounts of money sending people to the far reaches of space when we have so many problems right here on Earth?\u201d they ask. Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, who spent three decades playing a key role in US budget decision-making, calls ambitious manned space travel \u201cat best a luxury that the country ought not to be indulging in\u201d and \u201ca complete and total waste of money\u201d and \u201cpure boondoggle.\u201d 32 And the dramatic slashes to NASA\u2019s budget since the Space Race ended suggest that Frank isn\u2019t the only US politician to hold this view. Upon first assessment, Frank is being perfectly rational\u2014after all, in the face of concerns like healthcare, national security, education, and poverty, should we really make room for an \u201cadventure budget\u201d? And in that light, the graph projection above for The Future of Humans and Space seems all the more likely to continue on its current course. I\u2019ve spent the last couple months reading, talking, and thinking almost non-stop about what the coming chapters of this story will look like\u2014and my assumptions about the future have now changed dramatically. I think we\u2019re all in for a big surprise. Part 2: Musk\u2019s Mission \u2192 For those new to Wait But Why, blue circle footnotes (like this one) are good to click on\u2014they\u2019re for fun facts, extra thoughts, extraneous quotes from my conversations with Musk, and further explanation. \u21a9 It was actually the Germans who had the world\u2019s early lead in rocket technology, but when they lost the war, the Americans, Soviets, and British pillaged Germany\u2019s rocket engineers, with each successfully recruiting a number of them. The US was probably the biggest winner, snagging Wernher von Braun, who would ultimately lead them to their moon landing rocket, the Saturn V. \u21a9 Armstrong was selected to be the first man to walk on the moon, partially because he was known not to have an over-inflated ego. Gus Grissom might have been the front runner for the job, but in 1967, slated to command Apollo 1 on a mission to Low Earth Orbit, he and two other astronauts burned to death when they were trapped in a spacecraft as it caught fire during an on-the-ground test. Stressful. \u21a9 One inadvertent accomplishment during the Apollo 13 debacle was that the spacecraft at one point was farther away from Earth than any of the other Apollo missions, leaving the three Apollo 13 astronauts with the human high altitude record (248,665 miles / 400,187 km) that stands to this day. \u21a9 It\u2019s technically two rotations every sidereal day, which is about 23 hours and 56 minutes, and correlates to the Earth\u2019s rotation with respect to the stars instead of the sun. This annoys me because I don\u2019t get why they would base it on a sidereal day instead of a normal day and I don\u2019t want to spend the 17 minutes it\u2019ll take to find out\u2014if someone knows, please tell me in the comments. It also annoys me because sidereal is just an annoying word. \u21a9 Am I supposed to capitalize GIF? Unclear. \u21a9 The movie Gravity illustrated exactly what sucks about space debris. \u21a9 I\u2019m not sure people realize that before this, we had never actually seen what Pluto looks like\u2014it\u2019s too small and too far away for even our best telescopes to get a decent photo. Before these new images came in, everything that looked like a good photo of Pluto was actually an artist\u2019s rendition. That changed on July 14th. \u21a9 Pluto, discovered in 1930, was originally given planet status, but as we discovered more and more outer Solar System objects, we started to realize that Pluto was just the largest object in the crowded Kuiper belt, and that it kind of made no sense for it to be a planet. If it were alone out there, that would be one thing, but if none of the huge dwarf planets in the asteroid or Kuiper belts were planets (including Pluto\u2019s newly-discovered and almost-as-large neighbor, Eris), then there was no good reason Pluto should randomly be one. So the dramatically nerdy International Astronomical Union got together and, amidst tantrums on both sides, settled on an official definition for a planet: 1) Had to orbit the sun, 2) Had to be big enough to become spherical-ish under its own gravity, 3) Had to have cleared out its own orbit. Pluto failed on #3, since there are many other objects in its orbit, which is part of the Kuiper belt. One other fun fact while we\u2019re here: after Uranus was discovered and named, chemists soon after named a newly-invented element after it\u2014uranium. They did the same thing with neptunian (apparently there\u2019s a neptunium) after Neptune was named, and the newly-named Pluto turned into the naming of the element plutonium. \u21a9 An AU is an \u201castronomical unit\u201d\u2014the distance from the Earth to the sun\u2014which is about 93 million miles (150 million km). \u21a9 To get a feel for the size of Ceres and Vesta, here\u2019s what they\u2019d look like next to our moon. \u21a9 Awkwardly, after almost 20 years of battling for a Hubble budget and creating the telescope, and after finally having launched a risky and difficult Space Shuttle mission to put it into orbit, NASA received the first Hubble photos, only to find that they were blurry. Turns out the mirror curvature was off by 2.2 thousandth of a millimeter. An almost imperceptible error, but with the vast distances the telescope needed to take in, it was enough to ruin everything. It wasn\u2019t until almost four years later that another Space Shuttle mission was able to get back to the telescope to make a fix. The fix had to be worked out perfectly on Earth first, and the astronauts had to implement it perfectly in space\u2014the mirror shape is so precise that if an astronaut even brushed up against it by accident during the repair process, it would ruin it. Luckily, everything went well and from 1994 on, the Hubble has worked flawlessly. \u21a9 The Hubble is expected to fail at some point not too far from now, maybe before 2020. Without anyone up there to repair system failures since 2009, it\u2019s inevitable\u2014and its orbit will decay slowly until between 2030-2040, when it\u2019s expected to burn up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is kind of sad\u2014the original plan was to have a Space Shuttle retrieve it and safely return it to Earth, where it could be a celebrity in the Smithsonian. But the Space Shuttle program ended, and now the Hubble will die a horrifying death instead.

A single person who would like to find a great relationship is one step away from it, with their to-do list reading, \u201c1) Find a great relationship.\u201d People in unhappy relationships, on the other hand, are three leaps away, with a to-do list of \u201c1) Go through a soul-crushing break-up. 2) Emotionally recover. 3) Find a great relationship.\u201d Not as bad when you look at it that way, right? All the research on how vastly happiness varies between happy and unhappy marriages makes perfect sense, of course. It\u2019s your life partner . Thinking about how overwhelmingly important it is to pick the right life partner is like thinking about how huge the universe really is or how terrifying death really is\u2014it\u2019s too intense to internalize the reality of it, so we just don\u2019t think about it that hard and remain in slight denial about the magnitude of the situation. But unlike death and the universe\u2019s size, picking a life partner is fully in your control , so it\u2019s critical to make yourself entirely clear on how big a deal the decision really is and to thoroughly analyze the most important factors in making it. So how big a deal is it? Well, start by subtracting your age from 90. If you live a long life, that\u2019s about the number of years you\u2019re going to spend with your current or future life partner, give or take a few. I\u2019m pretty sure no one over 80 reads Wait But Why, so no matter who you are, that\u2019s a lot of time\u2014and almost the entirety of the rest of your one existence. (Sure, people get divorced, but you don\u2019t think you will. A recent study shows that 86% of young people assume their current or future marriage will be forever, and I doubt older people feel much differently. So we\u2019ll proceed under that assumption.) And when you choose a life partner, you\u2019re choosing a lot of things, including your parenting partner and someone who will deeply influence your children, your eating companion for about 20,000 meals, your travel companion for about 100 vacations, your primary leisure time and retirement friend, your career therapist, and someone whose day you\u2019ll hear about 18,000 times. Intense shit. So given that this is by far the most important thing in life to get right, how is it possible that so many good, smart, otherwise-logical people end up choosing a life partnership that leaves them dissatisfied and unhappy? Well as it turns out, there are a bunch of factors working against us: People tend to be bad at knowing what they want from a relationship Studies have shown people to be generally bad, when single, at predicting what later turn out to be their actual relationship preferences. One study found that speed daters questioned about their relationship preferences usually prove themselves wrong just minutes later with what they show to prefer in the actual event. 4 This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise\u2014in life, you usually don\u2019t get good at something until you\u2019ve done it a bunch of times. Unfortunately, not many people have a chance to be in more than a few, if any, serious relationships before they make their big decision. There\u2019s just not enough time. And given that a person\u2019s partnership persona and relationship needs are often quite different from the way they are as a single person, it\u2019s hard as a single person to really know what you want or need from a relationship. Society has it all wrong and gives us terrible advice \u2192 Society encourages us to stay uneducated and let romance be our guide. If you\u2019re running a business, conventional wisdom states that you\u2019re a much more effective business owner if you study business in school, create well thought-out business plans, and analyze your business\u2019s performance diligently. This is logical, because that\u2019s the way you proceed when you want to do something well and minimize mistakes. But if someone went to school to learn about how to pick a life partner and take part in a healthy relationship, if they charted out a detailed plan of action to find one, and if they kept their progress organized rigorously in a spreadsheet, society says they\u2019re A) an over-rational robot, B) way too concerned about this, and C) a huge weirdo. No, when it comes to dating, society frowns upon thinking too much about it, instead opting for things like relying on fate, going with your gut, and hoping for the best. If a business owner took society\u2019s dating advice for her business, she\u2019d probably fail, and if she succeeded, it would be partially due to good luck\u2014and that\u2019s how society wants us to approach dating. \u2192 Society places a stigma on intelligently expanding our search for potential partners. In a study on what governs our dating choices more, our preferences or our current opportunities, opportunities wins hands down\u2014our dating choices are \u201c98% a response\u2026to market conditions and just 2% immutable desires. Proposals to date tall, short, fat, thin, professional, clerical, educated, uneducated people are all more than nine-tenths governed by what\u2019s on offer that night.\u201d 5 In other words, people end up picking from whatever pool of options they have, no matter how poorly matched they might be to those candidates. The obvious conclusion to draw here is that outside of serious socialites, everyone looking for a life partner should be doing a lot of online dating, speed dating, and other systems created to broaden the candidate pool in an intelligent way. But good old society frowns upon that, and people are often still timid to say they met their spouse on a dating site. The respectable way to meet a life partner is by dumb luck, by bumping into them randomly or being introduced to them from within your little pool. Fortunately, this stigma is diminishing with time, but that it\u2019s there at all is a reflection of how illogical the socially accepted dating rulebook is. \u2192 Society rushes us. In our world, the major rule is to get married before you\u2019re too old\u2014and \u201ctoo old\u201d varies from 25 \u2013 35, depending on where you live. The rule should be \u201cwhatever you do, don\u2019t marry the wrong person,\u201d but society frowns much more upon a 37-year-old single person than it does an unhappily married 37-year-old with two children. It makes no sense\u2014the former is one step away from a happy marriage, while the latter must either settle for permanent unhappiness or endure a messy divorce just to catch up to where the single person is. Our Biology Is Doing Us No Favors \u2192 Human biology evolved a long time ago and doesn\u2019t understand the concept of having a deep connection with a life partner for 50 years. When we start seeing someone and feel the slightest twinge of excitement, our biology gets into \u201cokay let\u2019s do this\u201d mode and bombards us with chemicals designed to get us to mate (lust), fall in love (the Honeymoon Phase), and then commit for the long run (attachment). Our brains can usually override this process if we\u2019re just not that into someone, but for all those middle ground cases where the right move is probably to move on and find something better, we often succumb to the chemical roller coaster and end up getting engaged. \u2192 Biological clocks are a bitch. For a woman who wants to have biological children with her husband, she has one very real limitation in play, which is the need to pick the right life partner by forty, give or take. This is just a shitty fact and makes an already hard process one notch more stressful. Still, if it were me, I\u2019d rather adopt children with the right life partner than have biological children with the wrong one. ___________________ So when you take a bunch of people who aren\u2019t that good at knowing what they want in a relationship, surround them with a society that tells them they have to find a life partner but that they should under-think, under-explore, and hurry up, and combine that with biology that drugs us as we try to figure it out and promises to stop producing children before too long, what do you get? A frenzy of big decisions for bad reasons and a lot of people messing up the most important decision of their life. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the common types of people who fall victim to all of this and end up in unhappy relationships: Overly Romantic Ronald Overly Romantic Ronald\u2019s downfall is believing that love is enough reason on its own to marry someone. Romance can be a great part of a relationship, and love is a key ingredient in a happy marriage, but without a bunch of other important things, it\u2019s simply not enough. The overly romantic person repeatedly ignores the little voice that tries to speak up when he and his girlfriend are fighting constantly or when he seems to feel much worse about himself these days than he used to before the relationship, shutting the voice down with thoughts like \u201cEverything happens for a reason and the way we met couldn\u2019t have just been coincidence\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m totally in love with her, and that\u2019s all that matters\u201d\u2014once an overly romantic person believes he\u2019s found his soul mate, he stops questioning things, and he\u2019ll hang onto that belief all the way through his 50 years of unhappy marriage. Fear-Driven Frida Fear is one of the worst possible decision-makers when it comes to picking the right life partner. Unfortunately, the way society is set up, fear starts infecting all kinds of otherwise-rational people, sometimes as early as the mid-twenties. The types of fear our society (and parents, and friends) inflict upon us\u2014fear of being the last single friend, fear of being an older parent, sometimes just fear of being judged or talked about\u2014are the types that lead us to settle for a not-so-great partnership. The irony is that the only rational fear we should feel is the fear of spending the latter two thirds of life unhappily, with the wrong person\u2014the exact fate the fear-driven people risk because they\u2019re trying to be risk-averse. Externally-Influenced Ed Externally-Influenced Ed lets other people play way too big a part in the life partner decision. The choosing of a life partner is deeply personal, enormously complicated, different for everyone, and almost impossible to understand from the outside, no matter how well you know someone. As such, other people\u2019s opinions and preferences really have no place getting involved, other than an extreme case involving mistreatment or abuse. The saddest example of this is someone breaking up with a person who would have been the right life partner because of external disapproval or a factor the chooser doesn\u2019t actually care about (religion is a common one) but feels compelled to stick to for the sake of family insistence or expectations. It can also happen the opposite way, where everyone in someone\u2019s life is thrilled with his relationship because it looks great from the outside, and even though it\u2019s not actually that great from the inside, Ed listens to others over his own gut and ties the knot. Shallow Sharon Shallow Sharon is more concerned with the on-paper description of her life partner than the inner personality beneath it. There are a bunch of boxes that she needs to have checked\u2014things like his height, job prestige, wealth-level, accomplishments, or maybe a novelty item like being foreign or having a specific talent. Everyone has certain on-paper boxes they\u2019d like checked, but a strongly ego-driven person prioritizes appearances and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s above even the quality of her connection with her potential life partner when weighing things. If you want a fun new term, a significant other whom you suspect was chosen more because of the boxes they checked than for their personality underneath is a \u201cscan-tron boyfriend\u201d or a \u201cscan-tron wife,\u201d etc.\u2014because they correctly fill out all the bubbles. I\u2019ve gotten some good mileage out of that one. Selfish Stanley The selfish come in three, sometimes-overlapping varieties: 1) The \u201cMy Way or the Highway\u201d Type This person cannot handle sacrifice or compromise. She believes her needs and desires and opinions are simply more important than her partner\u2019s, and she needs to get her way in almost any big decision. In the end, she doesn\u2019t want a legitimate partnership, she wants to keep her single life and have someone there to keep her company. This person inevitably ends up with at best a super easy-going person, and at worst, a pushover with a self-esteem issue, and sacrifices a chance to be part of a team of equals, almost certainly limiting the potential quality of her marriage. 2) The Main Character The Main Character\u2019s tragic flaw is being massively self-absorbed. He wants a life partner who serves as both his therapist and biggest admirer, but is mostly uninterested in returning either favor. Each night, he and his partner discuss their days, but 90% of the discussion centers around his day\u2014after all, he\u2019s the main character of the relationship. The issue for him is that by being incapable of tearing himself away from his personal world, he ends up with a sidekick as his life partner, which makes for a pretty boring 50 years. 3) The Needs-Driven Everyone has needs, and everyone likes those needs to be met, but problems arise when the meeting of needs\u2014she cooks for me, he\u2019ll be a great father, she\u2019ll make a great wife, he\u2019s rich, she keeps me organized, he\u2019s great in bed\u2014becomes the main grounds for choosing someone as a life partner. Those listed things are all great perks , but that\u2019s all they are\u2014perks. And after a year of marriage, when the needs-driven person is now totally accustomed to having her needs met and it\u2019s no longer exciting, there better be a lot more good parts of the relationship she\u2019s chosen or she\u2019s in for a dull ride. ___________________ The main reason most of the above types end up in unhappy relationships is that they\u2019re consumed by a motivating force that doesn\u2019t take into account the reality of what a life partnership is and what makes it a happy thing. So what makes a happy life partnership? We\u2019ll explore in Part 2 of this post .

Lucy is part of Generation Y, the generation born between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s.  She\u2019s also part of a yuppie culture that makes up a large portion of Gen Y. I have a term for yuppies in the Gen Y age group\u2014I call them Gen Y Protagonists & Special Yuppies, or GYPSYs.  A GYPSY is a unique brand of yuppie, one who thinks they are the main character of a very special story. So Lucy\u2019s enjoying her GYPSY life, and she\u2019s very pleased to be Lucy.  Only issue is this one thing: Lucy\u2019s kind of unhappy. To get to the bottom of why, we need to define what makes someone happy or unhappy in the first place.  It comes down to a simple formula: It\u2019s pretty straightforward\u2014when the reality of someone\u2019s life is better than they had expected, they\u2019re happy.  When reality turns out to be worse than the expectations, they\u2019re unhappy. To provide some context, let\u2019s start by bringing Lucy\u2019s parents into the discussion: Lucy\u2019s parents were born in the 50s\u2014they\u2019re Baby Boomers.  They were raised by Lucy\u2019s grandparents, members of the G.I. Generation, or \u201cthe Greatest Generation,\u201d who grew up during the Great Depression and fought in World War II, and were most definitely not GYPSYs. Lucy\u2019s Depression Era grandparents were obsessed with economic security and raised her parents to build practical, secure careers.  They wanted her parents\u2019 careers to have greener grass than their own, and Lucy\u2019s parents were brought up to envision a prosperous and stable career for themselves.  Something like this: They were taught that there was nothing stopping them from getting to that lush, green lawn of a career, but that they\u2019d need to put in years of hard work to make it happen. After graduating from being insufferable hippies, Lucy\u2019s parents embarked on their careers.  As the 70s, 80s, and 90s rolled along, the world entered a time of unprecedented economic prosperity.  Lucy\u2019s parents did even better than they expected to.  This left them feeling gratified and optimistic. With a smoother, more positive life experience than that of their own parents, Lucy\u2019s parents raised Lucy with a sense of optimism and unbounded possibility.  And they weren\u2019t alone.  Baby Boomers all around the country and world told their Gen Y kids that they could be whatever they wanted to be, instilling the special protagonist identity deep within their psyches. This left GYPSYs feeling tremendously hopeful about their careers, to the point where their parents\u2019 goals of a green lawn of secure prosperity didn\u2019t really do it for them.  A GYPSY-worthy lawn has flowers . This leads to our first fact about GYPSYs: GYPSYs Are Wildly Ambitious The GYPSY needs a lot more from a career than a nice green lawn of prosperity and security.  The fact is, a green lawn isn\u2019t quite exceptional or unique enough for a GYPSY.  Where the Baby Boomers wanted to live The American Dream, GYPSYs want to live Their Own Personal Dream. Cal Newport points out that \u201cfollow your passion\u201d is a catchphrase that has only gotten going in the last 20 years, according to Google\u2019s Ngram viewer , a tool that shows how prominently a given phrase appears in English print over any period of time .  The same Ngram viewer shows that the phrase \u201ca secure career\u201d has gone out of style , just as the phrase \u201ca fulfilling career\u201d has gotten hot . To be clear, GYPSYs want economic prosperity just like their parents did\u2014they just also want to be fulfilled by their career in a way their parents didn\u2019t think about as much. But something else is happening too.  While the career goals of Gen Y as a whole have become much more particular and ambitious, Lucy has been given a second message throughout her childhood as well: This would probably be a good time to bring in our second fact about GYPSYs: GYPSYs Are Delusional \u201cSure,\u201d Lucy has been taught, \u201ceveryone will go and get themselves some fulfilling career, but I am unusually wonderful and as such, my career and life path will stand out amongst the crowd.\u201d  So on top of the generation as a whole having the bold goal of a flowery career lawn, each individual GYPSY thinks that he or she is destined for something even better\u2014 A shiny unicorn on top of the flowery lawn. So why is this delusional?  Because this is what all GYPSYs think, which defies the definition of special: spe-cial| \u2018speSHel | adjective better, greater, or otherwise different from what is usual. According to this definition, most people are not special\u2014otherwise \u201cspecial\u201d wouldn\u2019t mean anything. Even right now, the GYPSYs reading this are thinking, \u201cGood point\u2026but I actually am one of the few special ones\u201d\u2014and this is the problem. A second GYPSY delusion comes into play once the GYPSY enters the job market.  While Lucy\u2019s parents\u2019 expectation was that many years of hard work would eventually lead to a great career, Lucy considers a great career an obvious given for someone as exceptional as she, and for her it\u2019s just a matter of time and choosing which way to go.  Her pre-workforce expectations look something like this: Unfortunately, the funny thing about the world is that it turns out to not be that easy of a place, and the weird thing about careers is that they\u2019re actually quite hard.  Great careers take years of blood, sweat and tears to build\u2014even the ones with no flowers or unicorns on them\u2014and even the most successful people are rarely doing anything that great in their early or mid-20s. But GYPSYs aren\u2019t about to just accept that. Paul Harvey, a University of New Hampshire professor and GYPSY expert, has researched this , finding that Gen Y has \u201cunrealistic expectations and a strong resistance toward accepting negative feedback,\u201d and \u201can inflated view of oneself.\u201d  He says that \u201ca great source of frustration for people with a strong sense of entitlement is unmet expectations. They often feel entitled to a level of respect and rewards that aren\u2019t in line with their actual ability and effort levels, and so they might not get the level of respect and rewards they are expecting.\u201d For those hiring members of Gen Y, Harvey suggests asking the interview question, \u201cDo you feel you are generally superior to your coworkers/classmates/etc., and if so, why?\u201d  He says that \u201cif the candidate answers yes to the first part but struggles with the \u2018why,\u2019 there may be an entitlement issue. This is because entitlement perceptions are often based on an unfounded sense of superiority and deservingness. They\u2019ve been led to believe, perhaps through overzealous self-esteem building exercises in their youth, that they are somehow special but often lack any real justification for this belief.\u201d And since the real world has the nerve to consider merit a factor, a few years out of college Lucy finds herself here: Lucy\u2019s extreme ambition, coupled with the arrogance that comes along with being a bit deluded about one\u2019s own self-worth, has left her with huge expectations for even the early years out of college.  And her reality pales in comparison to those expectations, leaving her \u201creality \u2013 expectations\u201d happy score coming out at a negative. And it gets even worse.  On top of all this, GYPSYs have an extra problem that applies to their whole generation: GYPSYs Are Taunted Sure, some people from Lucy\u2019s parents\u2019 high school or college classes ended up more successful than her parents did.  And while they may have heard about some of it from time to time through the grapevine, for the most part they didn\u2019t really know what was going on in too many other peoples\u2019 careers. Lucy, on the other hand, finds herself constantly taunted by a modern phenomenon: Facebook Image Crafting. Social media creates a world for Lucy where A) what everyone else is doing is very out in the open, B) most people present an inflated version of their own existence, and C) the people who chime in the most about their careers are usually those whose careers (or relationships) are going the best, while struggling people tend not to broadcast their situation.  This leaves Lucy feeling, incorrectly, like everyone else is doing really well, only adding to her misery: So that\u2019s why Lucy is unhappy, or at the least, feeling a bit frustrated and inadequate.  In fact, she\u2019s probably started off her career perfectly well, but to her, it feels very disappointing. Here\u2019s my advice for Lucy: 1) Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling success.  The specific direction may be unclear, but it\u2019ll work itself out\u2014just dive in somewhere. 2) Stop thinking that you\u2019re special. The fact is, right now, you\u2019re not special.  You\u2019re another completely inexperienced young person who doesn\u2019t have all that much to offer yet.  You can become special by working really hard for a long time. 3) Ignore everyone else . Other people\u2019s grass seeming greener is no new concept, but in today\u2019s image crafting world, other people\u2019s grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you are, and if you just do your thing, you\u2019ll never have any reason to envy others. _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

To try to grasp some perspective, I mapped out the history of time as a series of growing timelines\u2014each timeline contains all the previous timelines (colors will help you see which timelines are which). \u00a0All timeline lengths are exactly accurate to the amount of time they\u2019re expressing. A note on dates: \u00a0When it comes to the far-back past, most of the dates we know are the subject of ongoing debate. \u00a0For these timelines, it\u2019s cumbersome to put a ~ sign before every ancient date or an asterisk explaining that the date is still being debated, so I just used the most widely accepted dates and left it at that.

I\u2019d be living my normal day, and then the thought would hit me\u2014\u201dMatt has a son\u201d\u2014 and my whole world would get turned upside down. Three years and six friend babies later, I\u2019m 32 and have numbed to the whole thing considerably. It\u2019s still weird. But not jarring . This new phenomenon in my life has introduced several new experiences\u2014things like \u201chaving your feelings hurt and losing self-confidence because your friend\u2019s toddler doesn\u2019t like you\u201d and \u201clearning that talking about the baby as a \u2018toy\u2019 or a \u2018pod\u2019 and commenting on \u2018it not having a brain yet\u2019 is less funny to the baby\u2019s parents than it is to you.\u201d But perhaps the most frequent new experience is finding myself in discussions about baby names, both in the form of talking to the impending parents and pressuring them to reveal the candidates, and talking to other friends about the eventual name choices behind the new parents\u2019 back. (Note: definitely best to keep the name candidates a secret until after the baby\u2019s born\u2014no name will please everyone and other peoples\u2019 opinions really shouldn\u2019t be part of the process for something so personal. And when you announce the name after the baby is born, everyone has to pretend they like it to your face no matter what they think, so you\u2019ll end up feeling like everyone likes it.) You\u2019d assume that thinking about baby names is a new thing in my life, but I\u2019ve actually had a lifelong fascination with the topic. My curiosity rose to a whole new level the day I discovered an amazing website called The Baby Name Wizard , and especially their Voyager tool, which lets you plug in a few letters or a whole name and see a visual depiction of its corresponding popularity trends over time. The Voyager is delicious and rents permanent space in my Dark Playground . (Of course, as soon as it was the topic of this post, putting Voyager play time in the Dark Woods for the first time ever, the monkey suddenly wanted to do other things and kept clicking away from the page. But that\u2019s a whole other topic.) So, for all these reasons, it seemed like the right time for a post about names, trends, and the things expecting parents need to think about as they make this decision. After many hours on The Baby Name Wizard (and the government\u2019s official name database ), here are my thoughts (focusing on the US unless otherwise stated)\u2014 Parents choosing a name have a few options: 1) Go Timeless Examples: John, James, William, David, Mary, Sarah, Elizabeth Benefits: You won\u2019t embarrass yourself; You won\u2019t pigeonhole the kid in any way, including generationally; It\u2019s classy; There\u2019s something cool about a common bond with centuries of previous humans Drawbacks: It\u2019s kind of boring. These names are often biblical, or sometimes those of famous royalty, and they\u2019re bigger than any one generation\u2014William is not a typical old man\u2019s name or young guy\u2019s name\u2014it\u2019s just William. And they\u2019re always popular. But they\u2019re less popular than they used to be. The Top 10 boys names in the 1880\u2019s share six members with the Top 10 boys names in the 1950\u2019s : John, William, James, Robert, Charles, and Thomas. But the Top 10 in 2012 only includes one name from that list\u2014William. 2) Go Super Weird Examples: Winter, Namaste, Jameliah, Stormy, Cameo, Grudzel Benefits: No one will ever question your balls; If the kid is awesome, then it\u2019s awesome. Drawbacks: They\u2019ll have to spell out their name on phone calls 2 trillion times throughout their life; They\u2019ll have to watch people figuring out how to react every time they introduce themselves; They\u2019ll get made fun of at school; It might hurt their chances of getting job interviews; If the kid isn\u2019t awesome, the whole thing is awkward; If you were just in a phase and made a compulsive decision, that\u2019s shitty cause the kid has to live with it forever. Despite several drawbacks, it\u2019s a nice chance to say, \u201cP.S. We don\u2019t give a shit about what other people think.\u201d And again, if the kid\u2019s awesome, a weird name just makes them even more awesome. For what it\u2019s worth, a lot more people are going weird now than they used to. People used to be almost uniformly conformist. In 1950, only 5% of parents strayed out of the Top 1,000 names when naming their child. In 2012, 27% of parents went weird and left the Top 1,000. This is part of a broader trend away from conformity: In 1880, the Top 4 boys names (John, William, James, George) covered one in every four boys. In 2012, the Top 4 boys names (Jacob, Mason, Ethan, Noah) cover only one in every 26 boys. 3) Go a Little Weird But Not Too Weird Examples: Ashton, Wyatt, Luca, Brooklyn, Delaney, Alexia Benefits: You\u2019re being nonconformist but without most of the drawbacks in Category 2; If it\u2019s a really good name people will be jealous and you\u2019ll be all thrilled with yourself; It says \u201cMy parents are cool but not too annoying.\u201d Drawbacks: You might be a little too pleased with yourself for someone who still let the Top 200 names dictate their choice; There\u2019s a chance a lot of other people feel the same way about that \u201cunconventional\u201d name and you inadvertently find yourself as part of a Name Fad. This category is perfect for parents who are far too thrilled with themselves and are having far too special a child for a Timeless or Top 10 Name, but who also look down upon those who go for a Super Weird Name as annoying or unclassy. (In case you\u2019re wondering, most of my friends went with Category 3.) But let\u2019s focus on something I mentioned in the drawbacks: The Name Fad . It turns out that sometimes you\u2019re not the only one who loves that fresh, oh-so-pretty name, and a Name Fad happens when millions of Category 3 couples all start to say \u201cWait I like that\u201d when they hear about someone else making a great Category 3 choice (it can also be started by a famous person\u2014e.g. the surge in Mileys in the last decade). Suddenly, that name so perfectly placed at #137 on the list of popular names is #86. Then the next year it\u2019s #41. Then #18. Then #5. All to the horror of the Category 3 couple. You know when everyone calls a guy by his nickname except his parents, who use his full three-syllable name? I think part of that is trying to wrench individuality from a fad name. The fad is heightened by another large category of parent choice\u2014 4) Just Dive Into the Current Honeymoon, Knowing You\u2019re Picking a Popular Name Examples: Anything from the current Top 20. Benefits: Safe; Hip; Bonds your child with his/her whole generation in a broad sense. Drawbacks: There will be three other kids in the class with the same name and they\u2019ll be referred to along with their last name initial; Your child will one day have a Middle-Aged Name, and one later day, an Old Person Name. To me, studying Name Fads throughout time yields the most interesting information because it speaks about something society is doing as a whole at a given time. Let\u2019s spend the rest of the post digging into Name Fads and how they work\u2014 Name Fads Here\u2019s what a Name Fad looks like: Between 1965 and 1985, everyone named their daughter Jennifer, and now, no one does. So Jennifer was officially a Name Fad. What this means for all the Jennifers of the world is that while they\u2019ve enjoyed spending most of their life so far with a cute, hip, young girl name, they are on their way to having a Your Mom\u2019s Friend\u2019s Name name. A Your Mom\u2019s Friend\u2019s Name name happens when lots of middle-aged people have a name that no young or old people have. A few decades after that, Jennifer can look forward to having an Old Lady Name, which happens when a name belongs to lots of old ladies, but no one under 75. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it\u2019s a fact that Jennifer is irreparably branded with her generation forever. Of course, Jennifer is just one of many such names. In 30 years, the names Natalie, Chelsea, Samantha, and Lindsay will sound how Nancy, Cheryl, Susan, and Linda do today. And in 60 years, the names Ethan, Cody, Brandon, and Matthew will be Earl, Chester, Bernard, and Melvin. These are all just Name Fads\u2014only difference is when they happened. If you want to know if your name is a fad, type it into the Voyager (not the search field at the top in the orange\u2014the one below where it says \u201cBaby Name >\u201d. If it looks like a witch\u2019s hat, it\u2019s a fad. So what\u2019s hot right now? Sophia and Emma in particular are not just sweeping the US, but the whole Western world. Sophia (or Sofia) is in the Top 6 baby names in Italy, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Argentina, and Chile. Emma is Top 6 in Ireland, Finland, Norway, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. Emma\u2019s popularity is also clearly caused by a wave of naming after great-grandmothers, another way people sometimes name a child: To stress how much more popular the biggest names used to be, Mary was six times as popular in 1880 as either Sophia or Emma is now. And looking at the other top names of 2012 emphasizes just how dead fads are once they\u2019re over: So to be clear, Gunner and Gael are currently more common baby names than Phillip or Scott. And Lyric, Paisley, and Brooklynn with two n\u2019s are all more common than Lindsay, Caitlin, and Erica. We\u2019re still close enough in time to the red name fads that they seem really common, but they\u2019re actually just fads. And they\u2019re over. Some other odd fads I observed while researching: Demographic-related fads Charlotte has a weird history. After dying out as a popular name for Southern women a few decades ago, Charlotte has returned as a popular name in the most liberal states. This graph shows popularity in each state over time, with the states going from most conservative on the top to most liberal on the bottom. So there are a bunch of middle-aged conservative women and liberal toddlers out there named Charlotte. The only time I ever saw a dead name return in fewer than 80 years is when it caught on with a totally different demographic (Jeremiah is another one of these, which after losing steam in the early nineties in the Northwest, has now gotten hot in the Deep South). We stole a lot of the hottest current names from Utah. Here\u2019s the history of the name Brooke: Utah got into the name in the early 70s by itself, and then suddenly in 1980, everyone else decided to jump on board. The same phenomenon goes for Natalie, Aubrey, Riley (m), Jaxon, Paisley, Braxton, and Lacey. (Yes, those are all popular names right now.) Not sure who made Utah the name prophecy state, but that\u2019s what it apparently is. We also stole Evelyn from California. Evelyn\u2019s Popularity Over Time The popular girl name Reagan is for Republicans. Same goes for Braxton, Brooklyn, and Jaxon. Sophia was originally for the richest states, before it got so popular everyone got into it. Sofia is still for rich states though: Paige is only for Northerners. Here\u2019s a map showing where Paige was popular in 2008. Same goes for Alexa, Kathleen, and Nicole. Meanwhile, Victor is mainly found in the Southwest, Colton in the middle of the country, Caroline in the East, and both Adrianna and Dominic are mostly contained to New Mexico. Fads around specific letters or sounds Names starting with a vowel were hottest now and 100 years ago, while many names starting with consonants were biggest in the middle of the century. Vowel Names Consonant Names And F names are for old people. Names starting with ERI, LA, and the sound CR all went through fads in the 1970s and 80s. They\u2019re all over now. There\u2019s a current fad going on for names starting in IS. People used to copy the president Genders being dicks Sometimes one gender is doing its thing, living its life, when one of its names is suddenly stolen by the other gender: Another case of females committing full-fledged robbery: Genders also get jealous when the other has too popular a name. Each of the following names has had the other gender in the Top 1,000 during some stretch of the past (click on a name to see its history with the opposite gender). John , William , James , George , Joseph , Michael , Thomas , David , Frank , Henry , Mary , Elizabeth , Sarah , and Margaret .

You can buy it here: Or see a preview here . _______________ On the morning of Saturday, August 2nd, I got in a taxi in Erbil, the regional capital of Kurdish Iraq, and asked the driver to take me to the Khazir refugee camp. This was a scary-ish thing to do. The \u201cscary\u201d part is a result of the fact that the Khazir camp is outside of the borders of the somewhat autonomous Kurdish region, one of the only secure parts of the country. The \u201cish\u201d part comes from the fact that the Khazir camp, though outside of Kurdish borders, is still in an area currently controlled by the Peshmerga\u2014the Kurdish army. Iraq has been a scary place for a while now, for a number of reasons, but it\u2019s currently scary in italics because of the terrorist group we\u2019ve all gotten to know about in the past three months\u2014ISIS. So, the cab driver, myself, and our two constricted assholes headed west towards Khazir. After about 45 minutes, we crossed the checkpoint that meant we were leaving the Kurdish region, and a few minutes later, right when my phone\u2019s blue dot was starting to get just close enough to Mosul for my liking, I looked out the car\u2019s right window and saw the camp: We pulled in, spent a bunch of time convincing the camp officials and ourselves that I was a journalist, and eventually I was allowed in. I didn\u2019t have a plan, exactly, so I started walking through the long lines of tents, noting that the 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C) temperature I had been suffering through all week must be almost lethal here, where the only escape was in a tent. After a few minutes, I met a man named Kamil who spoke some English, and he invited me into his family\u2019s tent. After talking with him a bit, I learned that it was actually a few families\u2019 tent, and that there were 12 people living in it\u2014five adults and seven children. There was electricity enough for a TV and a fan, and most of the mattresses were stacked on the side. He told me that 12 people to a tent was common at the camp, and mentioned that his tent was actually about to move to 13, gesturing toward one of the women living there who was thoroughly pregnant. Kamil was from Mosul, like everyone at the camp. Mosul is Iraq\u2019s second largest city, only 30 miles west of the camp\u2014and as of June 9th, an ISIS stronghold. After taking over, one of the first orders of business for ISIS was rounding up government workers for execution. Kamil, a police officer, was lucky to get out with his family before they got to him. When I asked him if he thought he\u2019d return to Mosul at some point, he shook his head and said, \u201c Fuck Mosul.\u201d As soon as he learned that I was going to be writing about my time in Iraq, he led me out of the tent to join him on a special Oh Okay Then I Want to Show You Exactly How Upsetting Everything Here Is So You Can Write About It and Tell Everyone Tour. He walked me past the communal tap for drinking water, and said people used that water to clean themselves too, having not seen a shower since they arrived. He showed me multiple babies that had been born at the camp. We popped into a bunch of different tents, one whose fan had been stolen (remember that it\u2019s 118\u00b0), and another that had 15 people living in it. He showed me where the shared toilets drain out into a system that flows openly through the camp. He told me that a lot of the families didn\u2019t have enough food and that people were getting sick more and more often and remaining untreated. And these were all people who two months earlier were living their normal lives in their normal homes. Remember the time I complained about anything? That was dumb. When Kamil introduced me to a man whose two brothers had been executed by ISIS, I assumed that had to be the tour\u2019s horrifying grand finale, but he wasn\u2019t done yet. He brought me into another tent where he introduced me to a woman living there, explaining to her that I was his new writer friend. Without missing a beat, she handed me these: Whatever I was holding, it was something bad, and I didn\u2019t want to ask what it was. I asked. He pointed across the tent to a little boy and explained that I was holding part of his skull . The boy was an eight-year-old named Mohammad. Their family\u2019s house had been bombed in the middle of the night during the first days of the ISIS takeover and subsequent Iraqi government airstrikes. I never learned why or if they were specifically targeted. But the end result was that this healthy little eight-year-old\u2014 \u2014was now this brain-damaged, partially deaf, blind in one eye eight-year-old with digestive difficulties: The goal of this post will be to understand why this sickening thing happened to this little boy\u2014to really understand what\u2019s going on in that country\u2014better than you do now. And if we really want to wrap our head around things, we have to start way, way back\u2014in 570 AD. _______________ Ingredient 1: An Ancient Schism In 570, a long-named baby was born to a prominent family in Mecca, a city on the west coast of what is currently Saudi Arabia\u2014Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn \u02bfAbd al-Mu\u1e6d\u1e6dalib ibn H\u0101shim. Today he\u2019s just known as Muhammad. 1 \u2190 click this Muhammad never had a father\u2014his father died six months before his birth\u2014and his mother died when he was six years old. 2 \u2190 again again After the death of his mother, Muhammad lived with his grandfather, and when he died two years later, Muhammad was transferred to his uncle, a merchant. With his uncle as his mentor, Muhammad became a merchant himself. Not too much is known about Muhammad\u2019s young adult years, but one thing we\u2019re pretty sure of is that he married a 40-year-old widow named Khadijah when he was 25 (he\u2019d have multiple more wives later in his life). They would go on to have four daughters and two sons, only one of whom survived into full adulthood\u2014his daughter Fatimah. It wasn\u2019t until Muhammad was 40 that his life started getting strange. He had gotten into the habit of going up to a mountain every year for a couple weeks to be alone, meditate, and pray. It was on one of these solo retreats in 610 AD that Muhammad was for the first time visited by the angel Gabriel. 3 As the story goes, Gabriel recited messages to Muhammad that were directly from God, which Muhammad memorized. Over the years, Gabriel would continue to visit Muhammad with messages, Muhammad continued to commit them to memory, and later, he would recite the memories to his followers, who would then write them down, and that became the Quran. Three years after the first visit from Gabriel, in 613, Muhammad began preaching the messages to the public, in his hometown of Mecca. This did not go well. At the time, Mecca was largely made up of polytheistic tribes who worshipped nature-related gods and goddesses, and one of Muhammad\u2019s main messages was that there was one god and any idols to other gods should be destroyed, which was awkward for everybody. People started reacting violently to Muhammad\u2019s growing influence, killing some of his followers, and they may have killed Muhammad too had he not belonged to a fancy family. But in 622, when Muhammad learned of an assassination plot against him, he and his followers decided to bail on Mecca and head to the nearby city of Medina. This journey is called the Hijra in Muslim tradition and it\u2019s celebrated on the first day of the Muslim year. Muhammad and his followers would spend the next eight years fighting off attempts to destroy them from Mecca and other places, and often being ruthless themselves with those who posed a threat to Islam or refused to convert. The thing a lot of people don\u2019t know is that in addition to being a spiritual leader, Muhammad was, in essence, the general of an army of followers and a tremendously effective strategist in growing and holding on to his leadership position in the face of lots of hostile competition. Things came to a head in 625 when the Meccans, who were increasingly losing prestige and support as Muhammad\u2019s following continued to grow, launched an attack on Medina and defeated the Muslims. But five years later, Muhammad and a 10,000 man army marched into Mecca and conquered it for good. By the time Muhammad died in 632, Islam had spread through the whole Arabian Peninsula. The Muslim World Splits The new Muslim world enjoyed 20 years of internal unity until Muhammad died, and then that was the end of that, forever. The problem is that Muhammad didn\u2019t appoint a successor before he died, or if he did, he didn\u2019t get the word out to everyone. And because he had no living sons, there was no obvious answer. Here\u2019s what happened: Group A thought that Muhammad wanted the elite members of the Muslim community to choose a fitting leader, or caliph, and whenever that caliph died, the elite would choose the next leader, and so on. And Group A decided a great first caliph to succeed Muhammad would be the father of one of Muhammad\u2019s wives, Abu Bakr (we\u2019ll call him Abu). Group B disagreed. They thought Muhammad would have told them that only God can choose the successor to lead the Muslim world, and that could only happen by keeping things in the family. To them, all signs pointed to Muhammad\u2019s cousin and the husband of his daughter Fatimah, Ali ibn Abi Talib (Ali). Group A was bigger and it won. So father-in-law Abu took over as Caliph, while son-in-law Ali watched from the sidelines and Group B seethed. When Abu died of illness two years after taking over, another friend of Muhammad\u2019s, Umar, took over, having been appointed by Abu before his death. Umar ruled for ten years before he was assassinated by the Persians he had just conquered. Abu had also appointed Umar\u2019s successor, Uthman, who ruled for 12 years before he was assassinated. All the while, Group B is helpless and frustrated. But then, the elite decided the next and fourth caliph should be Ali\u2014Group B\u2019s original guy\u2014and for two seconds, everyone was happy. Five years later, Ali was assassinated, and when his eldest son Hassan became the fifth caliph, he was quickly overpowered by an aggressive rebel force led by Muawiyah, who coerced Hassan out of power and became the sixth caliph\u2014and Group A and Group B would never reconcile again. While Muawiyah was the first of a long dynasty of caliphs, Group B tells a different story. To them, the leaders are more special than merely elected caliphs\u2014they\u2019re divinely chosen imams , and the way they see it, after an annoying three-caliph delay, their first imam was finally in power when Ali got the job. His eldest son Hassan was their second imam, and when Muawiyah kicked him out, Group B threw their support behind Ali\u2019s younger son, Husayn\u2014their third imam. Husayn, Group B\u2019s third imam, ended up being beheaded by Yazid, Group A\u2019s seventh caliph (Muawiyah\u2019s successor), and so Group B moved onto Husayn\u2019s son as their fourth imam, while Group A continued to ignore Group B and support their caliphs. This was over 1300 years ago, and yet today\u2019s Muslim world is still completely divided over it, and so much of today\u2019s Middle East strife is centered around this ancient split. Group A are Sunnis and Group B are Shias. Today\u2019s Sunni-Shia tensions are about a lot of things, but at their very core is what happened in the 7th century. Sunni Muslims believe in their line of caliphs, and don\u2019t believe them to be chosen by God, and Shia Muslims reject the first three caliphs and instead believe in the line of divinely-chosen imams starting with Ali, revering in particular Ali 4 and his son and the third imam, Husayn. Both sects agree that Muhammad is the final prophet, both follow the Five Pillars of Islam, and both view the Quran as the holy book\u2014but Shia are less unquestionably accepting of the Quran in its entirety, because they believe certain parts were recounted by people other than the imams. Here\u2019s a chart to help clear up all of this confusion: None of this stopped the early caliphs from conquering an insane amount of the world\u2014by 750, just 140 years after Muhammad\u2019s first revelation, the Muslim world had expanded its reach to a large portion of where it exists today. 5 6 But as Islam swept the Earth, this early schism only deepened\u2014it was here to stay. Ingredient 2: Straight Lines The land of Iraq has the coolest nickname of any land anywhere\u2014The Cradle of Civilization\u2014and for good reason. Ancient Iraqi history is as impressive as it gets. In particular, the fertile strip of Iraq in between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers known as Mesopotamia is often credited with the birth of writing ( cuneiform ), the invention of the wheel, some of the earliest sailboats, calendars, maps, schools, and the origin of the 60-minute hour and 60-second minute. 7 3,000 years later, when Alexander the Great conquered half the world, he chose that land to be his capital, selecting Babylon in particular for its treasures and its critical location between Europe and Asia. 1,000 years after that, the head of the great Abbasid Muslim dynasty built Baghdad on the same land to be the capital of the vast Muslim world, and for the next 500 years (until the Mongols stomped on it), Baghdad reigned as a world hub of learning and commerce and for a time, was the world\u2019s largest city. There may be nowhere in the world with a history as rich as the land of Iraq. The nation of Iraq, on the other hand, was created by two dicks with a pencil and ruler, and its history is mostly unpleasant. By the beginning of the 20th century, the land of Iraq had been part of the Ottoman Empire for 400 years. 8 There were several ethnic and religious groups on the land, left mostly free to keep to themselves and separate from the others. But when Germany and Co. took on France, Britain, and Russia in World War I, the Ottoman Empire elected to be part of the \u201cand Co.\u201d, which left them ultimately on the losing side. Bye bye Ottoman Empire. During the war, Mark Sykes of Britain and Fran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot of France got together with a pencil, a ruler, and a bottle of whiskey, and took to the map, carving the Ottoman Empire into nations and determining where their two nations and Russia would get to have spheres of influence after the war if they won. 9 Regarding the whole \u201cseveral ethnic and religious groups\u201d thing and the natural boundaries of separation that had developed between them over centuries, George-Picot famously remarked, \u201cWhatevs,\u201d and with pencil in hand, Sykes is quoted as saying, \u201cI should like to draw a line from the e in Acre to the last k in Kirkuk.\u201d 10 Here\u2019s what they came up with: 11 BBC The thing about creating borders using a map, pencil, and ruler, is that it\u2019s a terrible way to create borders. If you look at organically-created borders around the world\u2014those that were formed over time by the local populations, based usually on ethnic and religious divisions, and often demarcated by mountains, rivers, or other natural barriers\u2014they\u2019re squiggly and messy. What\u2019s a clear and satisfying straight-line-on-a-map border for imperial powers trying to keep things clean and simple for themselves is a complete disaster on the ground across the world where the actual place is. When borders are drawn this way, two bad things happen: 1) Single ethnic or religious groups are sliced apart into separate countries, and 2) Different and often unfriendly groups are shoved into a nation together and told to share resources, get along, and bond together over national pride for a just-made-up nation\u2014which inevitably leads to one group taking power and oppressing the others, resulting in bloody rebellions, coups, and sectarian violence. This isn\u2019t that complicated. 12 But since it wasn\u2019t really their problem, Sykes and George-Picot just went ahead with it, and over the next few years, precise new borders were drawn, giving birth to modern day Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Kuwait. Here was Iraq\u2019s new situation: Can\u2019t see why there\u2019d be any issue here. A Tight Lid For any of you readers considering creating a new, tense nation of ethnic and religious groups who don\u2019t like each other, I\u2019ve been researching this shit all month and I have advice for you: Your new nation is like a bubbling soup inside a pressure cooker and it\u2019s gonna spew itself all over the kitchen unless you have one critical thing that can keep things in order: a tight lid. The nation version of a tight lid can be either a strong western occupying power or an iron fist dictator with a scary military machine at his whim\u2014without one of these, your nation will fall apart. 13 Email me if you have any questions. 14 The new nation of Iraq combined Ingredient 1 (Sunni and Shia Arabs living in the same area) with Ingredient 2 (a border that forces them into a nation together, along with a large group of Kurds) to create a tense pressure cooker. Things were hot from the beginning, when the new Iraqis revolted against the British occupation in 1920. The British acted as a lid and crushed the revolt. After Iraq achieved independence and the British lid left, a series of military commanders took over the lid duties, stomping a number of revolts and killing each other in coups from time to time. In 1968, the Sunni Ba\u2019ath Party took over, under the leadership of new president Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and his ambitious vice president and general, Saddam Hussein. By 1979, Saddam\u2019s influence had grown to the point where he was kind of running the show, and finally he went to al-Bakr and was like, \u201cYou know what two cool things are? Murder and retirement. Ya know? I thought maybe you\u2019d want one of those? And you could choose?\u201d and al-Bakr stepped down, bringing Saddam Hussein, the tightest lid of them all, to power. A lot of things sucked about the 24 year rule of Saddam. He started off in typical dictator fashion, calling together all the senior ranking members of government, and then reading out the names of those who were thought to be disloyal, 22 of whom were later taken out back and shot. He all but legalized \u201chonor killings\u201d\u2014i.e. the tradition sometimes found in places run by Sharia Law whereby a man may kill a female relative if she dishonors her family, often without facing criminal charges. And he gave the world Uday Hussein. 15 But Saddam\u2019s worst crimes happened during the wars he started and their aftermath. Worried that the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran would inspire rebellion in Iraq\u2019s large Shia majority, Saddam launched into the eight-year Iran-Iraq War, which killed over 100,000 Iraqis. 16 Iraq\u2019s Kurds, who have never wanted to be a part of Iraq, seized the opportunity in the chaos to try to form their own autonomous country, at times receiving support from the Iranians. The attempt failed, and toward the end of the war, Saddam embarked on the al-Anfal Campaign, a systematic genocide of the Kurdish north. One of the worst moments came in 1988, just as the war was winding down, when residents of the city Halabja were overcome by the smell of sweet apples after war planes flew by overhead, and then people and animals started dropping dead all over the city from gas poisoning. The gassing caused more deaths than 9/11. The entire al-Anfal campaign killed between 50,000 and 180,000 Kurds. While we\u2019re here, let\u2019s pause for a second and talk about the Kurds. The Iraqi Kurdistan Blue Box This whole post was supposed to be about Iraqi Kurdistan, the Kurdish region in northeastern Iraq. But when I decided to go another direction, Kurdistan got left out. As a consolation, Kurdistan is being featured in Wait But Why\u2019s first ever blue \u201caside\u201d box (if you don\u2019t see a blue box, try clearing your cache). Here are some things about Kurdistan: Let\u2019s start by clearing one thing up: The Kurds are an ethnic group, like the Arabs. Kurds are a number of religions, but most of them are Sunni Muslims. So when people talk about Iraq\u2019s groups and they say \u201cSunni, Shia, and Kurds,\u201d what they mean is \u201cArab Sunni, Arab Shia, and Kurdish Sunni.\u201d Kurds speak Kurdish, though many also speak Arabic as a second language. Almost no ethnic group is a bigger victim of imperial ruler-pencil border drawing than the Kurds. Check out this map of the Kurdish population (in red) and how horribly it\u2019s been cut apart by borders: The end result of the artificial borders is that despite being the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East (after Arabs, Persians, and Turks), Kurds are now minority populations in four countries, making up roughly 20% of Turkey and Iraq, 15% of Syria, and 10% of Iran. 17 Kurds are one of the world\u2019s largest ethnic groups without a state. Iraqi Kurds were granted semi-autonomy in 1970, and today, Kurdistan has its own government, army (the Peshmerga), and (highly disputed) borders. But it also plays a role in the Iraq government and is part of Iraq. It\u2019s confusing. If Iraqi Kurdistan were its own nation, it would be about the size of Switzerland. Kurdistan is on the liberal, moderate side of the Islamic world and is generally pro-West. Kurdistan is normally totally safe to visit (right now might be an exception), and its tourism industry was on the rise\u2014in the first half of 2014 alone, they received over one million tourists\u2014but the industry has seen a sharp decline of late, for obvious reasons. Some notes from my visit: The people are outlandishly nice and sweet and friendly. One example: On no fewer than five occasions, I went up to a street stand or store to buy something small like a bottle of water, and the person working there would see I was a foreigner and ask me where I was from and how I liked Kurdistan. After we talked, I\u2019d take my money out to buy the thing I came for, and they would adamantly refuse to accept it and tell me it was their gift, even after protests from me. This wasn\u2019t a surprise. Iraq is the 14th Muslim country I\u2019ve been to, 18 and I\u2019ve gotten used to a very specific kind of Muslim hospitality and generosity in those countries that I haven\u2019t experienced as consistently in other places. There are a lot of serious-looking men sipping on tiny glasses of tea, which I enjoyed. They have cool candy . Erbil, the capital, is pretty modern\u2014I would sometimes be in a fancy mall or a German-run bar and I\u2019d have to remind myself, \u201cI\u2019m in Iraq right now.\u201d I talked to a lot of people there, and something that everyone badly wants is an independent Kurdistan. They\u2019ve wanted this for a century, and it seems like it could really happen sometime not that far away. The people I spoke to were generally pro-US, but they\u2019re not thrilled with Obama. This is mainly because the US in general has not been supportive of Kurdish independence\u2014I\u2019ve read about why, and it seems to be a combination of a few geopolitical reasons, one of which is that an Iraq without the Kurdish part is much more likely to become a Shia-dominated Iranian ally and pawn. Anyway, back to Saddam, who barely had time to take a shit after the Iran-Iraq War before starting the Persian Gulf War by invading Kuwait for its delicious oil reserves. This, as I learned from my third grade teacher, did not go well for Saddam, and again, Iraq\u2019s oppressed groups, the Shia and the Kurds, tried to take advantage of the situation by attempting to overthrow Saddam. Saddam responded by tightening the lid and crushing the uprisings, killing 80,000 \u2013 230,000 people in the process. 19 Saddam was a brutal ruler, but for the most part, under his iron fist, Iraq was a stable country. We all know what happens next. 2003: Off Comes the Lid Say what you want about the Bush Administration and their decision to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam, but one thing is for sure: They were very, very wrong when they thought it would be a quick and easy war. They knew they were removing a lid, but they seemed to think it was off a tupperware container of cookies, not a pressure cooker. And their plan to replace the wrought iron lid with a fresh sheet of democracy cellophane would have worked fine if it were a tupperware container of cookies. Just not if it were a pressure cooker. So there\u2019s the US, suddenly mired in hell and chaos for eight years, trying to fix a situation they weren\u2019t prepared to fix, and which would ultimately be the Iraqi people\u2019s problem, not theirs. Speaking of the Iraqi people, it\u2019s time for another blue box. The Life in Baghdad Blue Box The people I got to know the best during my time in Kurdistan were three brothers from Baghdad who were visiting Kurdistan. They were born and raised in Baghdad, had lived there through the whole war, and spoke near-perfect English. I was ecstatic to find them, and spent two consecutive nights talking to them and asking them questions. Here are some things I learned: Living under Saddam was, unsurprisingly, horrible. You never dared say anything bad about Saddam or the government, even in private. You were careful who you crossed\u2014if you insulted a kid in class who turned out to have parents in the Ba\u2019ath party, your parents could end up in jail, or worse. \u201cVoting\u201d meant \u201cvote for Saddam or die.\u201d No one could travel. It sounds a lot like modern day North Korea . So it makes sense that they told me everyone was happy when the US invaded and ousted the Husseins. People mock the Bush Administration\u2019s claim that they\u2019d be greeted as liberators, but it seems that that was the case, at least for everyone these guys knew. They continued to be happy about the war until about 2006, the peak of the violent civil war, when they said it had been unbearably scary to live there. These days, things are almost as terrible, and when I asked them if they wished that Saddam had never been overthrown, they couldn\u2019t really answer. Two awful options. They don\u2019t feel at all optimistic that things will improve in the future. That said, outsiders imagine that living in Baghdad was a sea of constant death over the last ten years, while in fact, none of the three of them knew anyone who had died. It was a horrific decade to be there, but most people there have lived their lives unharmed. Living in Baghdad, they hear a bomb go off almost every day\u2014it\u2019s gotten so common that when one goes off, people don\u2019t even break in their conversation. They said the bombs are Sunni extremists bombing Shia people, or the other way around, and it\u2019s a constant cycle of action and retaliation. Even though it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll get caught in the line of fire, they never know if a bomb will strike where they are. They\u2019re required to carry around their ID card, which has a bunch of personal information on it, including the name of their religion and the name of their father and grandfather. One thing that\u2019s gotten more extreme since the Saddam era is a prevailing conservative ideology. Homosexuality is often punished by death by stoning, and police, they said, will turn their heads the other way when this happens. People have even been stoned to death for having emo clothes or haircuts . This wasn\u2019t as bad during the Saddam era, they said, and is now a result of the empowerment of ultra-conservative Shia militia. Oddly, given the above point, I noticed a lot of pairs of men holding hands or being cuddly together. Same story in Nigeria, where homosexuality is punishable by 14 years in prison. The reverse of American culture on both sides of things. Here\u2019s how dating works in Iraq: You meet a girl you like, you wait a bunch of years, and then you tell her you love her one day. She will evaluate and either decide to marry you or not. Once you\u2019re married you can be alone together for the first time. Unslutty. I asked about nightlife, and it sounds pretty grim. There are nightclubs, they said, but no one normal can enter them. You have to \u201cknow someone,\u201d they said\u2014and apparently, a lot of the people inside are bad men discussing violent plots. For all the hardships in their lives, a lot of things are normal. They have smartphones, fast internet, cars, and they\u2019re all in university or already graduated. A lot of people they know have emigrated to Michigan, which apparently has a sizable Iraqi population. Random. These three brothers, along with a few others, have started something called World Peace Day in Iraq with celebrations every September 21st. They were the first in the country to have the guts to do this (their celebrations are a target), but it\u2019s caught on, and now the annual gatherings, which include people of many faiths and ethnicities, happen in five Iraqi cities and involve hundreds of people. Brave dudes. Anyway, as unfortunate as the bloody years of US occupation were for everyone involved, by being there, the US was acting as a lid of some kind. While the US was there, nothing really bad could happen. Then, in 2011, the US left. A Perfect Storm Instability is the fertile soil that bad, scary things grow out of, and when the US left, Iraq had a new prime minister, a new government, a new and unfamiliar constitution, and an amateur, recently-trained army\u2014not a stable situation. The power pendulum had also just swung for the first time in decades. Iraq\u2019s population is 55% Arab Shia, 18% Arab Sunni, and 21% Kurd (with others making up 6%). And despite being the smallest group of the three, Iraq\u2019s Arab Sunnis have been in power over the other groups for almost the country\u2019s whole history. For any living Iraqis, a Sunni government and suppressed Shia majority is all they know. Suddenly, in 2006, Iraq had a new government, led by a hard-line Shia, Nouri al-Maliki. A logical observer of history would probably suggest that it would be a wise move for al-Maliki to be inclusive of Sunnis, regardless of the past, since, as noted above, the country was not in a stable situation. Al-Maliki did just the opposite, arresting Sunni leaders, discriminating against Sunni civilians, and targeting Sunnis disproportionately for torture and violence. All of this exacerbated the instability by making the government less unified and competent, creating rage in the Sunni populous, 20 and weakening the loyalty of a military, part of which hates its own government. The anti-al-Maliki feelings are so strong that many normally-peaceful Sunnis find themselves sympathizing or even supporting violent anti-government terrorists. The power switch from Sunni to Shia has broader implications. If you look at the whole world of Islam, it\u2019s clear that Sunni Islam is the vast majority (around 90%) and Shia Islam (around 10%) is just a small side branch: But when you look at the heart of the Middle East more closely, you can see why things are so complicated. Here\u2019s what the Middle East looked like when Saddam was in power versus when al-Maliki took over: 21 Suddenly, Shias are in charge of countries all the way from Iran to the Mediterranean, creating a kind of Shia Axis. This is a great thing for the world\u2019s largest Shia nation, Iran, and it scares the shit out of the region\u2019s most powerful Sunni nation, Saudi Arabia. And what\u2019s been happening is Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in what is essentially a Cold War, vying for broader power, with conflicts like the Syrian Civil War and the current mess in Iraq serving as proxy wars that can tip the balance in the larger struggle. This is why Iran wants ISIS (a Sunni group) to disappear and why you keep hearing that the US and Iran might actually agree on something (though for different reasons). This is also why the Saudis have been rumored to have funded Sunni resistance movements in both Syria and Iraq, even possibly directing funds to groups like ISIS. 22 Yet another factor playing into the trouble is the simultaneous instability of adjacent Iraq and Syria\u2014this creates an unstable border, as well as a situation where the terrorist-fighting front is disjointed and without a shared national narrative to fight for. It also allows a terrorist group to hide in one country from trouble in the other. Finally, western powers often provide a lid from afar when things erupt somewhere\u2014but in this case, those powers have been gun shy since they just got out of a hideous war in the area and really really want to avoid getting involved. Up until Obama\u2019s Mid-September speech, the US has done everything possible to avoid getting involved. When you add this all together\u2014an unstable and divided new government with an amateur, questionably-loyal army and an angry minority population who feels sympathy for anyone who will resist the government; the interests of a giant neighbor, Saudi Arabia, aligned with a government overthrow; a civil war next door; and a group of western powers who have been determined to stay out\u2014you have the perfect storm for the fiercest of terrorist groups to emerge from the fringe and conquer. ISIS The beginnings of ISIS 23 \u2014a Sunni jihadist group\u2014can be traced back to 1999, when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian jihadist, started the group because he was pissed off about a lot of things. After Zarqawi swore allegiance to al-Qaeda in 2004, this evolved into what became known as \u201cal-Qaeda in Iraq,\u201d and was one of those shadowy insurgent groups you kept reading about the US fighting during the war. When insurgent activity died down after the US troop surge in 2007, ISIS seemed on the decline and disappeared from relevance for a bit. Al-Baghdadi In 2010, after ISIS\u2019s second leader was assassinated, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2014a former scholar of Islamic studies 24 and a US war prisoner back in 2004 25 \u2014took over and got the group back on track. He replenished their partially-killed-off leadership with dozens of Saddam\u2019s old Ba\u2019athist military personnel, who brought key experience to the group. Then in 2011, when the Syrian Civil War broke out, ISIS joined in as a rebel force 26 \u2014which helped to train and battle-harden the group. ISIS\u2019s behavior in Syria was so brutal and severe that they even started creeping out the other bad guy groups, including al-Qaeda, who finally had a tantrum in early 2014 and cut all ties with ISIS . Up until early June 2014, only those who were carefully following the news knew about ISIS. But that\u2019s when everything changed. On June 5th, just hours after I purchased my non-refundable flight to Iraq, ISIS stormed into the country, taking control of the border, and started systematically conquering towns in the western part of the nation. And suddenly, everyone had heard of ISIS. Two things were especially shocking about ISIS\u2019s advance into Iraq. First, the horrifying, Genghis Khan-style way they conducted business\u2014i.e. immediately round up and execute all men of authority, in this case anyone who was ever on the government payroll, and then execute anyone else who resisted their takeover. 27 Second, the fact that in city after city ISIS attacked, the Iraqi military would flee the scene . This was partially because they were horrified of ISIS and partially because, as mentioned above, the Sunni members of the army weren\u2019t that into fighting against a Sunni group to defend a government they hated. So western Iraq was folding quickly to ISIS, and by June 9th, they had captured Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second biggest city. The area of Syria and Iraq they had conquered (and are still in control of) is the size of Belgium. Al-Qaeda never conquered anything\u2014they just killed people. So how did ISIS do it? In addition to the perfect storm of factors discussed above, including far more tacit support from masses of civilians than al-Qaeda ever had, ISIS has three qualities that make them so effective: 1) They\u2019re brutal. No regard for human life is a helpful quality when trying to conquer a nation. This Amnesty International report details real accounts of ISIS brutality so scary it doesn\u2019t seem real. An example of an excerpt in the report: A witness to one such mass killing in Solagh, a village south-east of Sinjar city, told Amnesty International that on the morning of 3 August, as he was trying to flee towards Mount Sinjar, he saw vehicles with IS fighters in them approaching, and managed to conceal himself. From his hiding place he saw them take some civilians from a house in the western outskirts of Solagh: \u201cA white Toyota pick-up stopped by the house of my neighbour, Salah Mrad Noura, who raised a white flag to indicate they were peaceful civilians. The pick-up had some 14 IS men on the back. They took out some 30 people from my neighbour\u2019s house: men, women and children. They put the women and children, some 20 of them, on the back of another vehicle which had come, a large white Kia, and marched the men, about nine of them, to the nearby wadi [dry river bed]. There they made them kneel and shot them in the back. They were all killed; I watched from my hiding place for a long time and none of them moved. I know two of those killed: my neighbour Salah Mrad Noura, who was about 80 years old, and his son Kheiro, aged about 45 or 50.\u201d ISIS has officially been the deadliest terrorist group in history. In a tool that maps out the activity of the world\u2019s most prominent terrorist groups, when you filter by \u201cMost Victims,\u201d ISIS comes up first, despite being around for less than a decade (their death count is more than double al-Qaeda\u2019s lifetime total). The below screenshot of the tool shows terrorist groups ranked from most total killings (on the top left) to least (on the bottom right). Each mini-chart shows activity over time, with the red and yellow bars representing deaths and wounded, respectively: 2) They\u2019re sophisticated. ISIS functions like a well-run company\u2014it knows how to recruit (ISIS forces are supposedly up to 50,000 in Syria and 30,000 in Iraq), it knows how to fundraise, and it\u2019s incredibly organized. ISIS produces a thorough and professional annual report that details its killings and conquests in the same way a company would report on its revenue and gross margin. Here\u2019s a chilling graphic from their 2013 report breaking down their various methods for the year\u2019s 7,681 attacks: They\u2019re also pros at social media. Aaron Zelin, an expert on jihadis at the Washington Institute, said that when it comes to social media, ISIS is \u201cprobably more sophisticated than most US companies.\u201d 3) They\u2019re incredibly rich. According to Iraqi intelligence, ISIS has assets worth $2 billion, making it by far the richest terrorist group in the world. Most of this money was seized after the capture of Mosul, including hundreds of millions of US dollars from Mosul\u2019s central bank. On top of that, they\u2019ve taken oil fields and are reportedly making $3 million per day selling oil on the black market, with even more money coming in through donations, extortions, and ransom. ISIS has also gotten ahold of an upsetting amount of high-caliber, US-made weapons and tanks that were for the use of the Iraqi army but left behind when the army fled. They\u2019ve even gotten their hands on nuclear material that they found at Mosul University. On June 29th, ISIS just fully went for it and proclaimed itself a caliphate\u2014i.e. a global Islamic state\u2014and commanded all the world\u2019s Muslims to obey Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the grand caliph. Those living in ISIS-captured cities are getting a taste of what life in the new caliphate is like: Women have about as many rights as a goldfish, barely allowed to leave the house and forbidden from showing their faces in public. No smoking ever, and also no tampering with or disabling the smoke detector in the airplane lavatory. If they\u2019re not just rounded up and executed on the spot, Christians and other non-Muslims are forced to convert to Islam, pay a hefty non-Muslim tax, become a refugee, or die. The doors of Christian houses are marked with a \u0646, a symbol that signifies that they\u2019re Christian. Nazi-esque. Some reports say a fatwa (an Islamic law ruling by an authority) was issued declaring that all women between the ages of 11 and 46 would undergo genital mutilation, a tradition meant to suppress a woman\u2019s sexual desire in order to discourage \u201cimmoral behavior.\u201d 28 As for future goals, the short term goal is to establish an Islamic nation in the areas it currently controls, with some expansion of the boundaries. In the medium term, al-Baghdadi has declared that \u201cthis blessed advance will not stop until we hit the last nail in the coffin of the Sykes\u2013Picot conspiracy\u201d\u2014i.e. until those pencil and ruler lines drawn after WWI are gone and all the nations are part of the new caliphate. In the long run, ISIS wants to expand its caliphate to the reaches of the first Muslim dynasty in 750 AD, and beyond: Some people have argued that this map wasn\u2019t made by ISIS, but rather by their supporters. Even if that\u2019s so, al-Baghdadi\u2019s ambitions certainly seem to match, and exceed, those on that map. In July, al-Baghdadi put out a message to Muslims that assured them that ISIS \u201cwill conquer Rome and own the world.\u201d Over the past three months, as ISIS has marched through Iraq, 1.2 million Iraqis have become refugees. 700,000 of them are hiding under the protection of Kurdistan\u2019s Peshmerga army. One of those 700,000 refugees is eight-year-old and now badly-damaged Mohammad, who was living a normal life in Mosul when ISIS attacked. _______________ Five days after my visit to Khazir refugee camp, ISIS made an aggressive push forward into the scary-ish territory and captured the Khazir camp. The Peshmerga army retreated, instantly converting the area into scary-in-italics territory. That night, a black ISIS flag rose up over the camp where the Kurdish flag had been. Luckily, this happened after a few days of ISIS-Peshmerga fighting, and the refugees had time to run before ISIS arrived. But now, where do they go? People like Kamil, a police officer, cannot go back to Mosul\u2014his name was on the government payroll, and he would be executed upon arrival. But without significant money, many refugees are not allowed into Kurdistan either. Some simply camped out on the road in the searing heat. A few days later, with the help of US airstrikes, the Kurds recaptured the Khazir camp and a number of other areas ISIS had taken from them. Since my visit, two new developments offer some hope that things could possibly turn around. The first is that the polarizing Nouri al-Maliki is no longer the Prime Minister. He has been forced out and replaced by another Shia leader, Haider al-Abadi. We\u2019ll see if al-Abadi can cool off some of the Sunni rage al-Maliki\u2019s administration ignited. The second development happened on September 10th, when President Obama announced that the US would engage in a new campaign of airstrikes, both in Syria and Iraq, to try to defeat ISIS. Airstrikes are sure to slow ISIS down, but to take down and dismantle a group as shadowy, relentless, and fearless as ISIS, I doubt airstrikes will suffice. It\u2019s going to be a lot harder than that. More where this came from: This post is one of five in a travel series I wrote during the summer of 2014.

These notes will give me a place to sprinkle in fun extras I learned about, and sometimes just to expound on a point in the post without breaking up the flow. And since the posts are long, those who don\u2019t want to spend that long here can skip the notes, while those who want to dig in should check them out. Anyway, this note actually had a boring source-related purpose so let\u2019s get to it: Any historical account from 1400 years ago will likely have hazy parts of the story or areas where historians disagree\u2014and even more so when the story involves religion. My main source for this post are three books written by widely respected Islam scholar, William Montgomery Watt, with some additional information taken from the writings of Bernard Lewis, Muhammad Husayn Haykal, Martin Lings, Majid Ali Khan, and Richard C. Martin\u2014links to the sources at the bottom of the post. \u21a9 Sorry, I\u2019m in the honeymoon phase with the new note system and wanted to come hang out here again. Let\u2019s just quickly discuss how crazy it is that Muhammad\u2019s parents never knew that their son was important . Like, his mother fell ill and before she died she thought, \u201cI hope my little six-year-old makes something of his life\u201d and she has no idea what happened. Imagine what she\u2019d think if someone could have shown her the world in 2014, 1400 years in the future, and told her that 1.6 billion people revered her son. I know I make this point a lot about different people, and I\u2019m going to continue to make it when I come across it because it\u2019s crazy. Note, by the way, that you\u2019re scrolling inside of a footnote. Cool right? \u21a9 Or, depending on what you believe, it was the first time he started making up stories of being visited by an angel. \u21a9 The word Shia derives from \u201cShiatu Ali\u201d which means \u201cfollowers of Ali.\u201d While we\u2019re here, I\u2019m as confused as you are about Shia/Shi\u2019a/Shiite\u2014I read a bunch of things and it didn\u2019t become clearer when to use which. I\u2019m just gonna stick with Shia. \u21a9 You\u2019ll notice Spain included in the 8th century Muslim world. It would stay that way for almost 800 years until the land would be reconquered by Christians in 1491, who would then spend the next 250 years systematically purging the land of its Islamic tradition. If you look hard, you can still find remnants of Islam in Spain\u2014one example is the word \u201cOjala,\u201d which means \u201cI hope\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s hope,\u201d but its actual definition is \u201cMay God will it\u201d and is derived from \u201cO Allah.\u201d \u21a9 Speaking of where Islam exists today, here\u2019s a cool \u201cweighted\u201d map that shows each country\u2019s Muslim population. \u21a9 And if you\u2019re into the Bible, both the site of the Garden of Eden and Ur, the hometown of Abraham, are within the borders of modern day Iraq \u21a9 Here\u2019s a gif that shows the Ottoman Empire expansion timeline, if you\u2019re interested. \u21a9 Here\u2019s a map that shows what the Middle East looked like in 1914, right before WWI. As you can see, most of it was already under the influence of European imperial powers, with the waning Ottoman Empire as the exception\u2014so that was what was left to be carved up by Sykes and George-Picot after the war. \u21a9 Surprisingly, one of those two quotes is actually real. Source: A Line in the Sand, James Barr, p.12 \u21a9 Here\u2019s a photo of the original map they drew on. \u21a9 Of course, the same principle is behind most of the African civil wars\u2014remember the history chart in the Nigeria post ? Another striking example is the creation of the Afghanistan/Pakistan border in 1893 by another aloof British guy\u2014this line (called the Durand Line) sliced through the middle of the ethnic Pashtun population, creating a huge amount of ethnic strife and ultimately turning the Durand line into a Taliban hotbed. Over a century later, this is still causing massive trouble. Great map showing this here . \u21a9 A quintessential example of the Tight Lid Principle is Yugoslavia, a nation also formed in the wake of WWI, which consisted of modern day Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The tight lid in Yugoslavia\u2019s case was dictator Josip Broz Tito. When Tito died in 1980, the repressed tensions all boiled to the surface, and the country broke up soon after, with a bunch of blood shed in the process. \u21a9 Don\u2019t actually. \u21a9 Welcome to the Uday Hussein footnote! Today, in this footnote, we\u2019ll make a bullet list about Uday, literally the worst person who has ever lived: Uday was the older of Saddam\u2019s two sons, and as such, expected to take over for his father one day When Uday was young, Saddam would take him and his brother Qusay to watch prisoners be tortured or executed. Uday in particular relished the experience Picture the obnoxious, mean, super-rich kid in high school, but now picture that he has the power to have his bodyguards beat you to a bloody pulp, or kill you, or kill you and your whole family, with the snap of his finger In college, Uday would from time to time notice an exceptionally pretty girl, tell his bodyguards to bring her to his room, where he\u2019d rape her and sometimes then have his bodyguards kill her He would sometimes walk into a club and if he saw a really attractive girl dancing with a man, and it made him feel jealous, he\u2019d have the man killed He killed a man for refusing to let Uday dance with his wife He would stand on his balcony with binoculars, and when he\u2019d spot a pretty girl he\u2019d have his men retrieve her for him. Once he did this with a man\u2019s 12 and 14-year-old daughters, and the man had no choice but to accept or they\u2019d all be killed He was obsessed with torture and loved to experiment with different forms, including using an iron maiden he owned and putting someone alone in a room with his hungry pet tiger He killed his father\u2019s friend/bodyguard because Uday suspected that he was setting his father up with prostitutes He once killed a man who didn\u2019t salute him Even Saddam was creeped out by how cruel and reckless Uday was, so much so that he appointed younger brother Qusay to be his successor instead of Uday This made Uday incredibly jealous, and he would do things like hear about a girl Qusay slept with and have her brought to him to be raped and permanently branded with a U To give him something to do, Saddam appointed Uday as the head of the Olympic committee. Uday would have athletes who performed poorly tortured, sometimes locking them in iron chests in the sun for three days Uday was notorious throughout Iraq and universally loathed by everybody Uday and Qusay were both killed in a fire fight with US troops in 2003 No one was sad I hope you enjoyed the Uday Hussein footnote! All of these nuggets were gathered from two sources: this documentary and this article . \u21a9 Some counts put the toll as high as 500,000 \u21a9 Imagine if some powerful faraway country decided to draw new borders in Europe which cut France in three pieces, making the French population an oppressed minority group in Spain, Italy, and Germany with no country of their own. The Kurds\u2019 situation is shitty . \u21a9 brag \u21a9 Many suggest that the George H.W. Bush Administration misled the Kurds and Shias to believe that the US was behind their uprisings and would protect them if necessary. \u21a9 This map comparison shows the religious makeup of Baghdad\u2019s neighborhoods in 2005 vs 2007, illustrating just how tense the sectarian animosity has become since al-Maliki took over. Source . \u21a9 Lebanon\u2019s Shia population represents the majority of Muslims in Lebanon, but not the majority of the population (there is a significant Christian population). Lebanon\u2019s government is not totally Shia run either\u2014they have a minority of seats in the Parliament\u2014but again, they carry more power in government than do Lebanon\u2019s Sunni population, and Hezbollah has a large amount of popular support and more power than their seat number would suggest. \u21a9 Saudi Arabia denies this . \u21a9 ISIS has a lot of names. First of all, ISIS doesn\u2019t even stand for what people think it does (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), it stands for Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. Al-Sham refers to the Levant, the region that encompasses Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel-Palestine. So the second common name of the group, ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) is a synonym for the first. Before either of those was ISI (Islamic State of Iraq), and as of June, the group has renamed itself IS (Islamic State). Some leaders within Islam reject the name Islamic State and call it the less-glamorous QSIS (al-Qaeda Separatists in Iraq and Syria). I\u2019m going to stick with ISIS. \u21a9 According to this pro-ISIS biography , which may or may not be accurate \u21a9 Supposedly, as al-Baghdadi was leaving the prison after his release, he said to one of the guards, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in New York.\u201d \u21a9 This makes sense, since the Syrian government is Shia and the exact kind of entity ISIS wants to bring down \u21a9 ISIS has a habit of videotaping their executions and putting them online. Kind of a weird thing to link to here, so I won\u2019t, but you can find these videos on liveleak.com if you want to give yourself nightmares. \u21a9 This practice has affected 125 million women worldwide, according to the WHO , most of them in Africa.

Buy it here. In a post last year , we laid out the human lifespan visually. By years: By months: And by weeks: While working on that post, I also made a days chart, but it seemed a bit much, so I left it out. But fuck it. The days chart blows my mind as much as the weeks chart. Each of those dots is only a single Tuesday or Friday or Sunday, but even a lucky person who lives to 90 will have no problem fitting every day in their life on one sheet of paper . But since doing the Life in Weeks post, I\u2019ve been thinking about something else. Instead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it in activities or events. To use myself as an example: I\u2019m 34, so let\u2019s be super optimistic and say I\u2019ll be hanging around drawing stick figures till I\u2019m 90. 1 If so, I have a little under 60 winters left: And maybe around 60 Superbowls left: The ocean is freezing and putting my body into it is a bad life experience, so I tend to limit myself to around one ocean swim a year. So as weird as it seems, I might only go in the ocean 60 more times: Not counting Wait But Why research, I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I\u2019ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I\u2019ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest. Growing up in Boston, I went to Red Sox games all the time, but if I never move back there, I\u2019ll probably continue at my current rate of going to a Sox game about once every three years\u2014meaning this little row of 20 represents my remaining Fenway visits: There have been eight US presidential elections during my lifetime and about 15 to go. I\u2019ve seen five presidents in office and if that rate continues, I\u2019ll see about nine more. I probably eat pizza about once a month, so I\u2019ve got about 700 more chances to eat pizza. I have an even brighter future with dumplings. I have Chinese food about twice a month and I tend to make sure six dumplings occurs each time, so I have a fuckton of dumplings to look forward to: But these things aren\u2019t what I\u2019ve been thinking about. Most of the things I just mentioned happen with a similar frequency during each year of my life, which spreads them out somewhat evenly through time. If I\u2019m around a third of my way through life, I\u2019m also about a third of my way through experiencing the activity or event. What I\u2019ve been thinking about is a really important part of life that, unlike all of these examples, isn\u2019t spread out evenly through time\u2014something whose [already done / still to come] ratio doesn\u2019t at all align with how far I am through life: Relationships. I\u2019ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I\u2019ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood. Being in their mid-60s, let\u2019s continue to be super optimistic and say I\u2019m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that\u2019s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years. When you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I\u2019ll ever spend with each of my parents\u2014assuming I\u2019m as lucky as can be\u2014this becomes starkly clear: It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I\u2019m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We\u2019re in the tail end. It\u2019s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left. The same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%. So what do we do with this information? Setting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here: 1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else. 2) Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you\u2014not by unconscious inertia. 3) Quality time matters. If you\u2019re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you\u2019re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious. ___________ You can buy a PDF of this post here .

Last night, I received two texts from Bari Weiss: Any interest in writing a short piece about that jaw-dropping launch? And why you brought your daughter to see it? The first question is an easy one. I\u2019ve been fascinated by space ever since I gained sentience sometime in the mid-1980s. I had the order of the planets down by age four, and a few years later I could (and did) tell people that you could fit a thousand Earths inside Jupiter and a thousand Jupiters inside the sun. I remember being amazed watching videos of the moon landing\u2014but also confused. The cars, telephones, TVs, and computers of my childhood were worlds more advanced than anything my parents had as kids. But with space, the normal order of things was reversed: My parents grew up exhilarated by Apollo missions to places no man had gone before, while I was watching the space shuttle take astronauts a little hop above Earth\u2019s surface to do some technical work on the International Space Station. I remember feeling a deep envy of people who were around in the 1960s. It didn\u2019t make sense. The problem turned out to be this: 1 People living in the 1960s thought the moon landing was just the beginning. By 2024, they\u2019d have imagined, there would be a permanent moon base, lots of space tourism, and even people walking around on other planets. As it turns out, the 1960s were a fluke. It was the height of the Cold War and \u201cdesperate times call for desperate measures\u201d justified all kinds of unusual behaviors\u2014including spending five percent of the federal budget to one-up the Soviet Union in the space race. That brief spike in space expenditure put a man on the moon, captivated all of humanity and reminded us of what\u2019s possible when we put our minds together. Then the Cold War moved on, shifting its tensions to other arenas. Space became less of a critical mission and more of a fun hobby. What had been five percent of the federal budget in the mid-1960s dropped to one percent by the mid-1970s and 0.5 percent in recent decades. Any hopes I had that the U.S. would decide to become rad about space again were dashed in 2011, when the space shuttle program was shut down for good . Now we couldn\u2019t even launch astronauts into low Earth orbit. When we wanted to send Americans into space, we had to politely ask Russia to do it for us . I get it. We have many more pressing needs than space. A politician campaigning today on dedicating five percent of the budget to space would be laughed out of the room. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s such a shame . The moon landing was a tantalizing glimpse into the incredible potential of our species\u2014and a frustrating reminder that without desperate times, that potential remains largely untapped. Then came SpaceX. I first heard about it in 2012 when 60 Minutes did a segment on the company. Over the next few years, I watched as SpaceX kept defying expectations, successfully launching progressively bigger and more legit rockets into orbit. In what is still the most surprising day of my life, one day in 2015 Elon Musk reached out to me, said he had read my recent blog post on AI , and asked if I\u2019d be interested in writing about SpaceX. Over the next few months I visited the SpaceX facilities, looked at their rockets up close, interviewed dozens of their engineers, and talked with Musk about the big vision for the company. I wrote about it all in a big blog post . At the time, SpaceX was singularly focused on one of the space industry\u2019s holy grails: rocket reusability. Imagine if every commercial airplane flight ended with the passengers parachuting to the ground and the plane crashing into the ocean. With every plane flying exactly once, a brand-new plane would be needed for every flight. Tickets would cost millions of dollars, limiting air travel to billionaires and governments. Until recently, that was how space travel worked. Every rocket flew once, making space available only to billionaires and governments. What if, somehow, rockets could be like planes, ending each mission by landing instead of crashing the rocket? Each rocket could be used hundreds of times instead of once, dramatically cutting down the price of space travel and revolutionizing the industry. In late 2015 a SpaceX rocket launched, sent its payload into orbit, and for the first time in human history, came back down and landed . I watched from SpaceX headquarters. The cheer was so deafening you could feel the vibration move through your body. In the face of a million doubts, SpaceX showed that a private company could not only launch rockets but do it better than any government ever had. Soon, the U.S. government was using SpaceX, not Russia, to launch its astronauts. But reusability was just a stepping stone on the way to SpaceX\u2019s real mission: colonizing Mars. If you have critical information stored on a hard drive, it\u2019s common sense to back up the info on a second hard drive. That\u2019s how Elon Musk views humanity. We currently have all our eggs in one planet. To give our species the best chance of survival in the long run, he believes, we should live on multiple planets. We\u2019re fortunate to have another potentially livable rocky planet nearby. Why not try to use it? Bringing people to Mars requires a rocket far larger and smarter than any we had ever built. So SpaceX built Starship , a beast the height of a 40-story skyscraper. 2 To make trips to Mars affordable, the rocket has to be reusable, which means this thing has to land. So SpaceX got busy innovating, designing a system to catch the landing rocket between two giant arms. Last week, SpaceX announced that on Sunday, October 13, they would perform Starship\u2019s fifth test launch and, for the first time, attempt to catch the gargantuan rocket on the way down. I knew one thing: I sure as shit wasn\u2019t going to miss this. I made arrangements to travel to Boca Chica, Texas, to watch. So the answer to Bari\u2019s first text was easy. I love writing about anything related to space. Yes. But how about the second text? And why you brought your daughter to see it? Let me first say that \u201cdaughter\u201d is generous. What I have is a little two-foot-tall, 19-month-old gnome. Many times over the course of the weekend journey, I asked myself the same question. Why did I decide to bring a toddler with me? I asked myself that question at 6:30 a.m. Sunday morning while making the 30-minute walk down the beach from the hotel to the viewing spot, which would have been much easier without lugging a fussy, under-slept, 27-pound medicine ball with me\u2014all for something she won\u2019t begin to understand or appreciate or remember. We arrived at our spot and waited. Then, suddenly, the bottom of the rocket exploded into color. The launch began in silence for a few seconds while the roaring sound zipped along the water toward us. Then it got loud . My daughter hated it, saying \u201cNo?\u201d repeatedly, which is her way of pleading with me to make it stop. But soon, like everyone else, she was staring wide-eyed at the flying skyscraper as it bored its way upward through the thick atmosphere, painting a beautiful strip of vivid white and orange cloud across the clear sky. Way above us, we watched it separate into two little dots: The spaceship heading around the world with plans to crash into the Indian Ocean, and the rocket that was\u2014somehow\u2014turning around and coming back toward us. I can say with confidence: Watching a skyscraper falling from the sky is one of the most surreal things I have ever seen. Noticing my daughter still fixated on the cloud, I redirected her attention to the falling rocket. Near the ground, with a new streak of fire shooting out of its engines, it slowly hovered its way over to the tower and into the gentle embrace of the robot arms. The crowd roared. My wife, who gives one percent as much of a shit as I do about space, was in tears. It\u2019s hard to wrap your head around SpaceX\u2019s mission. If they actually succeed in putting a single human on Mars, let alone their goal of a million people, it will be one of the major milestones in not just human history but life history\u2014on par with the moment animals first began to walk on land. Whether or not they end up pulling it off, space is officially exciting again. But the reason rocket launches make people emotional isn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s the feeling of swelling pride that comes from being in awe of your own species. It\u2019s the feeling of hope that comes from being reminded of our insane potential when thousands of people work together toward a goal. It\u2019s the happy version of the post-9/11 feeling of wanting to hug every stranger you see. These emotions are especially refreshing at a time when we\u2019re surrounded by their polar opposite: the pessimism and petty cynicism that pervade our age of suffocating tribalism. As the father to a smiley little gnome, I desperately want to shield her from the negativity that will swirl around her as she grows up. I won\u2019t be able to do that. But what I can do is continually redirect her attention to the rocket, showing her all the ways our species is incredible. I can use \u201crocket launch emotion\u201d as a parenting compass and try, as many times as I can, to give her experiences that fill her with that particular magical, high-minded feeling. If along the way I also train her to be my little space nerd friend, all the better. _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

I\u2019m Jake Tapper. Dana Bash: And I\u2019m Dana Bash. Let\u2019s get started. Tapper: We\u2019ll begin with the economy. President Biden, since you took office, inflation has slowed but prices remain high. What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump? Biden: Look at what Mr. Trump left me when I became president. We had an economy in free fall. Everyone was unemployed. Thousands were dying of Covid, it was like a zombie apocalypse, and Trump was just drinking bleach. Then I came to office and put the pieces back together. We brought insulin shots down to 15 dollars. Senior citizens pay no more than 200 dollars a year for healthcare. Tapper: Mr. Trump? Trump: We had the greatest economy in the history of this world or any other world. There are some great fictional worlds out there, like the Emerald City, which by the way has a great economy, but not as good as ours. No economy had ever done as well as ours did when I was in office. Everybody was amazed by it. All the other countries said they wished I was their president. In Asia or Europe or Peru, go ask them and they\u2019ll tell you how amazed they were by the job I did. Inflation is killing us. Biden: A better economy than the Emerald City? I don\u2019t know anyone who thinks that. My friend who I talked to the other day doesn\u2019t think that. He said you were a worse president than Herbert Hoover, and that\u2019s saying something because Herbert Hoover could give a rat\u2019s ass who shows up at the local gooseberry growing contest. I don\u2019t know what happened at last year\u2019s contest but those are some good gooseberries. When Trump was president we were still killing people in Afghanistan. I\u2019m the only president where no one has died anywhere in the world. Tapper: Mr. Trump, you say you want to extend the tax cuts you put in place. With the U.S. facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now? Trump: The tax cuts are why we had the greatest economy in human or animal history. I was just about to zero out the debt when Covid hit. So instead I made the vaccine, and it was a tremendous vaccine, and then he took over and did a very poor job. When I was president the whole world loved America and admired me. Now we\u2019re a disgusting piss-covered Third World country. Biden: I\u2019m going to fix the tax system. We have a trillion thousandaires in this country\u2014excuse me, a million trillionaires. Billionaires pay only $150 in taxes. I paid more than that when I worked at Padula\u2019s ice cream stand when I was 15. I paid the taxes I owed. If billionaires paid their fair share we\u2019d be able to wipe out the debt. We\u2019d be able to pay for childcare, eldercare, healthcare. We\u2019d be able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u2019ve been able to do with, dealing with everything we have to do with everything that we have to be able to deal with. Trump: Tapper: Bash: Biden: The. Trump: Tapper: Bash: Biden: We finally beat Medicare. Tapper: For fuck\u2019s sake. Okay let\u2019s talk about Roe v. Wade. Trump: Everyone wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and I mean everyone. And I did that. These people are sick. They want to abort eight-month fetuses. Nine-month fetuses. Newborn babies. Older fatter babies. Boddlers. Toddlers. There\u2019s no one these people won\u2019t abort. President Biden tries to abort his political opponents. It\u2019s a disaster. Bash: President Biden? Biden: It\u2019s ridiculous to say everyone wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade. I didn\u2019t. My friend didn\u2019t. The women didn\u2019t, including that one who was murdered by an immigrant. He went to the funeral. But here\u2019s the deal. There\u2019s a lot of women raped by their in-laws, by their spouses, by their brothers and sisters, by their children and grandmothers, it\u2019s ridiculous, I saw this one video where the pool boy came into the house looking all sweaty and asked for a glass of water, and you know how that goes, you\u2019ve seen the videos, and then they can do nothing about it and they try to arrest them when they cross state lines. Tapper: President Biden, on the issue of border security, a record number of migrants have illegally crossed the southern border on your watch. Why should voters trust you to solve this crisis? Biden: I hired more border patrol. I hired more asylum officers. This is why there are no more illegal immigrants. He put babies in cages. I\u2019m going to continue until we get the total initiative relative to what we\u2019re going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers eating a salami on Wednesday. Trump: I have no idea what the fuck he said at the end there and I don\u2019t think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of borders, and then he just opened them right up. He opened them to prisoners and lunatics and rapists and child molesters and terrorists and wildlings and white walkers. These are not good people. We had the safest border in history according to border patrol who, by the way, endorsed me for president, I won\u2019t say that here but they endorsed me, I won\u2019t talk about it but it was Brandon, Brandon from border patrol endorsed me, I won\u2019t mention his name here but it was Brandon R. Knight who lives at 246 Longmeadow Drive in El Paso with his dogs, beautiful dogs by the way, it was the safest border and now we have the worst border in history. And these migrants are staying at the best hotels, great five-star hotels, while our veterans are on the street because he hates veterans. Biden: Okay everything he just said is a lie. For example, I don\u2019t hate veterans, I\u2019d give my life for a veteran. I\u2019d give a veteran a handjob in a Denny\u2019s bathroom. We\u2019ve done more for veterans than anyone in American history. Bash: Let\u2019s talk about Russia and Ukraine. Former President Trump, Vladimir Putin says he\u2019ll only end the war if he gets to keep some of Ukraine and Ukraine stops trying to join NATO. Are Putin\u2019s terms acceptable to you? Trump: Our veterans can\u2019t stand Biden. They think he\u2019s the worst commander-in-chief that we\u2019ve ever had. They wouldn\u2019t take a handjob from him in a Denny\u2019s bathroom even if they were desperate. If we had a real president, Putin never would have invaded Ukraine. And Hamas never would have attacked Israel. When I was president, Hamas liked Israel. You know those silly little caps Jews wear on their head? When I was president, Hamas wore those caps too. Out of respect for me. President Biden is like a Palestinian, and not one of the good ones either, he\u2019s a bad one, he\u2019s a weak Palestinian, he\u2019s not even one of the scary Palestinians, he can\u2019t even yell \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d correctly and the other Palestinians can\u2019t stand him, they can\u2019t stand this guy. Biden: I\u2019ve never heard so much malarkey in my life. I\u2019m a great Palestinian. Bash: Former President Trump, would you support the creation of an independent Palestinian state to achieve peace in the region? Trump: I make great deals. I made great deals as a kid. As a teenager. As an adult. As an old man. I made NATO put up biyyons and biyyons of dollars. I told them, if you don\u2019t pay, I don\u2019t play. And you know what happened? Biyyons and biyyons of dollars came flowing in the next day. But now we\u2019re paying everyone\u2019s bills again. Tapper: Mr. Trump, I want to talk about January 6 th . After you rallied your supporters that day, some of them stormed the Capitol. As president, you swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. What do you say to voters who believe you violated that oath on January 6 th and worry that you\u2019ll do it again? Trump: Let me tell you about January 6 th . On January 6 th , we had a secure border. On January 6 th , we were energy independent. On January 6 th , somewhere out there, a little boy had his first hamburger because we had made America great. Tapper: Please answer the question. Trump: I had nothing to do with anything that happened on On January 6 th . Even Nancy Pelosi said that. She said, \u201cPresident Trump had nothing to do with January 6 th , it was all my fault.\u201d Biden: He\u2019s a convicted felon. Trump: His son is a convicted felon. Biden: He had sex with a porn star in the other room while his wife was giving birth. He has the morals of an alley cat. Alley cats: wtf Trump: I didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star in the other room while my wife was giving birth, she had sex with me. Biden: He said fine people on both sides. Trump: No I didn\u2019t. Biden: Yes you did. He said Hitler has done good things. Trump: Only some. Bash: President Biden, black Americans are struggling. What do you say to black Americans who are disappointed you haven\u2019t made more progress? Biden: I\u2019ve helped black Americans in all kinds of ways. It\u2019s inflation that\u2019s hurting them, not me. Trump: You caused the inflation. Biden: I know you did but what did I do? Bash: President Trump, will you do anything to slow the climate crisis? Trump: The blacks love me. They made me an honorary black. Bash: Trump: When I was president, I had stopped climate change. I had the best environmental numbers in history. Biden: I passed the most extensive climate change legislation in history. Blacks love me. I built labs in historically black colleges so they could do science like white colleges. Trump: Illegals are destroying our country. Biden: And by the way. Biden: Tapper: Mr. Trump, the average cost of childcare in this country has risen past $11,000/year per child. In your second term, what would you do to make childcare more affordable? Trump: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Biden: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Trump: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Biden: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Tapper: Mr. Trump, the question was about childcare. Trump: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Biden: He\u2019s the worst president in this history of this country. Tapper: Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis? Trump: China. Tapper: Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis? Trump: Illegals are killing this country. Tapper: Mr. Trump, what will you do to address the opioid crisis? Trump: Democrats pay too much for hostages. I pay almost nothing. Bash: K. President Biden, frankly you\u2019re old as cock. How do you address concerns about this? Biden: I used to be young. America is a great country. Bash: Former President Trump, you\u2019re also appallingly old. How do you address the same concerns? Trump: I just won two club championships. To do that you have to be smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. He couldn\u2019t hit a ball 50 yards. I have the body and mind of a 23-year-old. Biden: I\u2019m a six handicap. Trump: My tits you are. Biden: I\u2019m an eight handicap. Trump: I\u2019ve seen your swing. Bash: Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election and say political violence of any form is unacceptable? Trump: Of course political violence is unacceptable. I hated when Nancy Pelosi ushered in all those people to the Capitol on January 6 th . I\u2019m running because he\u2019s the worst president in the history of this country. Bash: Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election? Trump: Putin never would have attacked Ukraine if I had been president. Bash: Mr. Trump, will you pledge to accept the results of this election? Trump: If the election is fair and free and I win of course I\u2019ll accept the results. Biden: Whiner. Trump: Complainer. Tapper: It is blessedly now time for the candidates to deliver their closing statements. Time for the big, lofty, heartfelt speech. Biden: I didn\u2019t raise taxes on most people. He instituted a 10% tariff, which is the same as raising taxes. He wants to make it so we can\u2019t negotiate with big pharma companies. We got it down to $35 for insulin, which is $20 more than I said earlier in the debate, and a $2,000 cap for senior healthcare spending, which is ten times the figure I said earlier tonight. That\u2019s huge progress in just a couple hours. Trump: This guy sucks. All he does is let people pour in over the border. We\u2019re living in a hellish rat\u2019s nest. No one likes you. No one respects you. God I\u2019m good. No one\u2019s ever seen anything like it before. We live in a shit country. Because of you, I need to make America great again again. Bash: Thank you I guess. _______ More places to go: Presidential debate transcripts from 2020 and 2016 My book about how our politics got to this state The American Presidents: Washington to Lincoln _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.

There was a total solar eclipse passing through the US, but I was in NYC, far from the path. Was I really gonna get on a plane to see a cool thing for two minutes? Nah. I had shit to do. 1 The day came. I put my stupid glasses on and saw the sun become a little less big and then back to being full size again. It was mildly interesting. Then the reports started coming in from the people who had seen it from the totality zone. People were like \u201cit was an indescribably profound, perspective-shifting, life-altering experience.\u201d They were like \u201cI\u2019m a different person now, someone who can only be understood by other people who saw the total solar eclipse.\u201d It was massively FOMOy and upsetting. Solar eclipses happen when the moon passes directly through the invisible line connecting the sun and Earth, something that doesn\u2019t happen very often because space is big and the invisible line is skinny. Here\u2019s a very not-to-scale diagram 2 (to make it to scale, picture the sun being a basketball on one side of the basketball court, the Earth being a 2mm-diameter pebble on the other side of the court, and the moon being a small grain of sand about 7cm away from the pebble). Earthlings are very lucky, eclipse-wise. Most planets don\u2019t have a big enough moon to create a total solar eclipse. Not only is our moon big enough, it\u2019s about exactly the size of the sun in our night sky because, by sheer coincidence, the sun is about 400 times farther from us than the moon and also about 400 times bigger than the moon in diameter\u2014making our eclipses especially breathtaking. There are about 70 total solar eclipses every century, each resulting in a thin path of total sun blockage. For most of history, there was no way to know when or where they would happen. Only the very lucky few who happened to be in the right place, at the right time, with the right weather, got to experience a total solar eclipse. Today you can ensure that you see one\u2014and I had passed up the opportunity. I would not be making the mistake again. I went online and learned that there would be another total solar eclipse passing through the US in 2024, and then that would be it until 2045 . 1 It went on my calendar that day. As fortune would have it, the 2024 eclipse\u2019s path of magical totality would be passing right over my new hometown of Austin, Texas. It was perfect. Then came the weather reports. Austin was going to be cloudy on eclipse day. Nope. Not okay. It wasn\u2019t an option to not see this eclipse. My friend Liv Boeree was equally psychotic about this, so we decided on Sunday night that Monday morning we\u2019d get on a flight to somewhere in the eclipse\u2019s path that was forecast to have clear skies. We settled on Arkansas. Early the next morning we flew to Little Rock where we were joined by our friend Peter, got in a car, and drove northwest to the dead center of the totality path, where the total eclipse would last for more than four minutes . We ended up in a big open rural field that may or may not have been part of someone\u2019s farm. It was us and some cows. The sky was perfectly clear. 30 minutes until totality. I looked through my glasses at a crescent sun. It seemed a little dimmer out than usual, but only a little. 20 minutes. Thinner crescent, a tad dimmer, maybe slightly cooler than it was before? 10 minutes. Razor-thin crescent now, definitely weird lighting. Because all of the light is coming from one small area, shadows are very sharp. You can see the shadow of individual hairs on your head. 1 minute. It\u2019s very dim, like early evening, but still feels like daytime generally. Waves of light and dark ripple across the ground, like the way light moves at the bottom of a swimming pool. 5 seconds. Diamond ring! I take off my glasses and the diamond ring looks strikingly beautiful and strange. 4, 3, 2, 1. The Earth\u2019s dimmer switch suddenly goes downnnnn as dim daylight drops into night. Totality. Imagine a world where there was always cloud cover, and one day every few years, in certain places, the sky cleared at night, and you could see stars for the first time in your life. It would be a totally surreal experience, something that reminded you that you don\u2019t live in a big world but on the edge of a tiny rock in vast outer space. It would show you the truth about reality. We see stars all the time, so we\u2019re well-acquainted with our reality living in outer space (even if it\u2019s easy to forget during the day). But when I looked up at the sky during the total eclipse, it was the first time I had experienced another, totally different way to see with my eyes that I lived in outer space. I saw one sphere positioned in front of another sphere, with two other spheres\u2014Venus and Jupiter\u2014floating nearby. More than ever before, it felt obvious that I was standing on the edge of a fifth sphere. For the first time in my life, I was looking at the Solar System. I looked around. It was dark. At 2pm. There was a 360\u00b0 sunset along the entire horizon\u2014another first. By a minute in, there was a chorus of chirping crickets that hadn\u2019t been there before. Birds were flying around overhead that hadn\u2019t been there before. The cows continued being cows but I assume they were super confused. I looked back up at the Solar System and noticed a little imperfection on the edge of the black moon circle, which I later learned was a solar prominence . A solar prominence I could see with my naked eye . Only half of my brain was focused on the eclipse because the other half was frantically trying to figure out how to best use the precious minutes. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t spend more than 30 seconds doing stuff with my camera, but I was not gonna not take pics. I got things all focused and snapped this gem: Just kidding that\u2019s Andrew McCarthy \u2018s photo. But mine was pretty good too: Okay fine that one is from NASA. 3 Here\u2019s my actual photo: Whatever. Anyway, eventually it ended. The glorious diamond ring reappeared, followed by me being blinded before remembering to not look at the sun anymore. Earth\u2019s dimmer switch swooped back up, as night turned to day in a few surreal seconds. It was over. Thoughts were processed. Emotions were felt. It was very very VERY worth the last-second trip. For any of you who pulled a 2017 Tim and decided not to see this one, I hope I\u2019ve sufficiently FOMOed you into making sure you see this for yourself, sometime soon, in some part of the world. \ud83c\udf3b ___________ More from the cosmos: The Fermi Paradox How (and Why) SpaceX Will Colonize Mars The Big and the Small _______ If you like Wait But Why, sign up for our email list and we\u2019ll send you new posts when they come out.
